"CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not
fall out of a tree",,"The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of code generation, with various benchmarks emerging to evaluate their performance across different programming languages. A prominent theme in recent research is the exploration of multilingual capabilities in code generation models. Cassano et al. (2022) introduced MultiPL-E, a scalable and extensible system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to multiple languages, thereby creating a massively multilingual code generation benchmark. Their work highlights the potential of LLMs to generalize knowledge from one programming language to another, demonstrating that models like Codex can match or even exceed their performance on Python for several other languages. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the multi-language performance of code generation models, which is crucial for understanding the impact of language features and frequency on model performance.

Similarly, Raihan et al. (2024) addressed the limitations of existing code generation benchmarks, such as the HumanEval Benchmark, by introducing mHumanEval, a multilingual benchmark supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. Their work emphasizes the importance of task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope in evaluating code generation models. By employing machine translation methods and providing expert human translations for diverse natural languages, mHumanEval offers insights into the cross-lingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art models. This research underscores the need for benchmarks that capture the multilingual potential of LLMs, which is essential for developing models that can generate code from low-resource language prompts.

In addition to multilingual benchmarks, the concept of leveraging multi-language outputs to enhance code generation performance has been explored by Xue et al. (2024). They proposed the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), an ensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming languages to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. By treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert"" and integrating their outputs, MPLE leverages the complementary strengths of different programming languages, resulting in more accurate and robust code generation. Their approach, which achieved new state-of-the-art results on the HumanEval benchmark, highlights the potential of ensemble strategies in improving code generation quality across various LLM models.

While these studies have made significant strides in evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for code generation, they primarily focus on the semantic correctness of generated code. In contrast, our research delves into the structural understanding of code, particularly the ability of LLMs to trace execution paths. By extracting code solutions from the HumanEval benchmark and analyzing the execution traces, we reveal the limitations of current models in appreciating the structural control flow of code. Our work introduces the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which measures a model's ability to trace code execution, including advanced structural components like recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. This focus on structural reasoning complements existing benchmarks and provides a new dimension for evaluating code generation models, highlighting the need for further improvements in code reasoning abilities.",Large Language Models and Code Generation,"['Federico Cassano, John Gouwar, Daniel Nguyen, Sydney Nguyen, Luna Phipps-Costin, Donald Pinckney, Ming-Ho Yee, Yangtian Zi, Carolyn Jane Anderson, Molly Q Feldman, Arjun Guha, Michael Greenberg, Abhinav Jangda (2022).

"Partially private, optimistic, distributed, and verifiable machine learning inference",,"The increasing importance of privacy in distributed machine learning (ML) systems has been a focal point of recent research, with various approaches being explored to ensure data and model security. Wei and Liu (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions in creating trustworthy distributed AI systems, emphasizing the need for robustness, privacy, and fairness. Their work categorizes privacy protection as a critical component during both distributed learning and model inference, highlighting the vulnerabilities that exist regardless of the architecture employed. This aligns with our research focus on safeguarding model parameters during inference, as we aim to address the privacy concerns that arise in distributed ML environments by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs.

In the realm of distributed learning architectures, Zhang et al. (2023) explore the trade-offs between Federated and Split Learning, proposing a hybrid approach that enhances both privacy and efficiency. Their work underscores the importance of balancing computational demands with privacy preservation, a theme that resonates with our approach of using zkSNARKs to ensure verifiable and tamper-proof inference. By selectively revealing model sections, our method complements the privacy goals of Federated and Split Learning, while also addressing the scalability challenges associated with large model parameters.

The concept of privacy-aware inference is further explored by Zhuang and Mao (2024), who develop a cooperative edge inference system that integrates a distributed resource bidding mechanism. Their approach focuses on minimizing data privacy leakage through intermediate feature compression, demonstrating the potential of decentralized decision-making in enhancing privacy. Our research shares a similar objective of enabling privacy-preserving inference, particularly in edge computing scenarios. By employing zkSNARKs, we provide a mechanism for model providers to maintain control over model exposure, thus fostering trust among participants in a distributed setting.

In summary, the existing body of work highlights the critical need for privacy-preserving techniques in distributed ML systems, with various strategies being proposed to address data and model security. Our research contributes to this ongoing discourse by introducing a novel solution that leverages zkSNARKs for partial privacy in distributed ML inference.

"SpikeDecoder: Realizing the GPT Architecture
with Spiking Neural Networks",,"The exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the realm of natural language processing (NLP). This section reviews relevant literature that has contributed to the development of SNNs for NLP tasks, highlighting the advancements and challenges in this field.

Recent efforts to integrate SNNs into NLP have been marked by innovative approaches to spike-driven language modeling. Xing et al. (2024) introduced SpikeLM, a pioneering model that employs a fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, both discriminative and generative. The authors address the challenge of encoding semantic information with binary spikes by proposing an elastic bi-spiking mechanism that enhances spike representation through direction, amplitude, and frequency encoding. This approach significantly narrows the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling, demonstrating higher accuracy than previously possible (Xing et al., 2024). SpikeLM's contribution lies in its ability to handle general language tasks with fully spike-driven models, setting a precedent for future research in spike-based NLP.

Complementing the work on spike-driven language modeling, Knipper et al. (2024) focus on the energy-efficient application of SNNs in NLP, specifically addressing the challenge of encoding text into spike trains. Their study, SNNLP, compares various text encoding methods and introduces a novel technique that surpasses the widely-used Poisson rate-coding method by 13% in performance on sentiment analysis tasks. The authors highlight the substantial energy efficiency gains of SNNs implemented in hardware, achieving a 32x increase during inference and a 60x increase during training compared to traditional deep neural networks (Knipper et al., 2024). This work underscores the potential of SNNs to revolutionize NLP by offering a more sustainable and brain-like processing model.

Both SpikeLM and SNNLP contribute to the growing body of research that seeks to leverage the energy-efficient nature of SNNs for NLP applications. While SpikeLM focuses on enhancing spike representation for general language tasks, SNNLP emphasizes the importance of effective text encoding methods to facilitate seamless integration with SNN architectures. These studies collectively highlight the promise of SNNs in reducing energy consumption while maintaining competitive performance in NLP tasks.

Building on these foundational works, our research introduces SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, specifically designed for NLP applications. Unlike previous models that primarily focus on encoder blocks or general language tasks, SpikeDecoder targets the decoder component of the Transformer architecture, offering a novel approach to energy-efficient NLP. Our work extends the investigation into the impact of replacing ANN components with spike-based alternatives, examining residual connections and spike-compatible normalization techniques. Additionally, we explore various embedding methods to project text data into spike-range, contributing to the ongoing discourse on effective text encoding for SNNs. By demonstrating a significant reduction in theoretical energy consumption, our research positions SpikeDecoder as a promising solution for sustainable NLP, advancing the field towards more efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms.",spiking neural networks in natural language processing,"['Xingrun Xing, Zheng Zhang, Ziyi Ni, Shitao Xiao, Yiming Ju, Siqi Fan, Yequan Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Guoqi Li (2024).

Recent research has explored the application of MLLMs to various domains, including animal behavior recognition and comprehensive video understanding. Wu et al. (2024) investigate the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs in the context of animal activity recognition, specifically focusing on piglet behavior. Their study highlights the potential of MLLMs in livestock video understanding, identifying areas for improvement such as semantic correspondence and time perception. This work underscores the importance of enhancing MLLMs' temporal understanding capabilities, a challenge also addressed in our research through the development of the T2Vid method to improve instruction diversity and temporal comprehension (Wu et al., 2024).

In a broader context, Han et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements in multimodal pretrained models, emphasizing the integration of diverse data forms such as text, images, audio, and video. Their tutorial covers the evolution of multimodal research and the technical challenges faced by these models, including instruction tuning strategies to optimize performance for specific tasks. This aligns with our approach of leveraging pre-trained image-LLMs and fine-tuning them with video data to enhance video understanding capabilities. The insights from Han et al. (2024) into instruction tuning are particularly relevant to our work, as we aim to enrich the training corpus with synthesized video-like samples to improve learning efficiency and performance.

Zou et al. (2024) focus on the unique challenges posed by long video understanding, highlighting the differences between static image, short video, and long video comprehension. Their survey traces the advancements of MLLMs from image understanding to long video understanding, emphasizing the need for models to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal details and long-term dependencies. Our research addresses similar challenges by demonstrating that our proposed training scheme can enhance long video understanding without the need for extensive long video samples. This is achieved by integrating synthesized data that enriches the instruction diversity, thereby improving the model's ability to comprehend dynamic events and long-term temporal information (Zou et al., 2024).

In summary, the existing body of work on MLLMs highlights the ongoing efforts to improve visual perception, temporal understanding, and instruction tuning across various domains. Our research contributes to this field by proposing an efficient data augmentation method that leverages pre-trained image-LLMs for video understanding. By addressing the limitations of zero-shot inference and enhancing the fine-tuning process with enriched instruction diversity, our study offers a novel approach to achieving high performance with reduced sample sizes.

Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners,2411.19865,"In recent years, the field of enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention, with various approaches being proposed to bridge the gap between human-like reasoning and machine learning models. A prominent theme in this domain is the integration of structured reasoning modules to improve the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in out-of-distribution tasks. Collins et al. (2022) introduced a hybrid Parse-and-Solve model that augments distributional LLMs with symbolic reasoning capabilities, demonstrating improved performance in planning and explanation generation tasks [1]. This approach highlights the potential of combining statistical language models with structured reasoning to achieve more human-like behavior, a concept that aligns with the objectives of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework, which seeks to enhance reasoning through reverse thinking.

Another significant theme in the literature is the augmentation of LLMs with retrieval capabilities to enhance factual accuracy and reasoning robustness. Lee et al. (2025) proposed ReaRAG, a model that integrates retrieval-augmented generation to improve the factuality of reasoning models [2]. By iteratively querying a retrieval engine, ReaRAG effectively guides reasoning steps, addressing issues of overthinking and lack of robustness. This iterative approach to reasoning is akin to the backward reasoning component of REVTHINK, where reasoning is refined by considering the problem from the solution's perspective, thus enhancing overall reasoning performance.

The exploration of reasoning strategies in LLMs has also been extensively surveyed by Bandyopadhyay et al. (2025), who provide a comprehensive overview of existing techniques and challenges in reasoning-imbued language models [3]. Their work underscores the importance of reasoning as a critical capability for complex problem-solving, which is a foundational aspect of our REVTHINK framework. Similarly, Xi et al. (2024) introduced MeTHanol, a model architecture that incorporates intermediate layer thinking to enhance reasoning capabilities [4]. This modularized approach to thinking and reasoning resonates with the multi-task learning objectives in REVTHINK, where different reasoning tasks are trained simultaneously to improve model performance.

Finally, Yang et al. (2024) addressed the challenge of reasoning self-awareness in LLMs by proposing the Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR) framework, which leverages synthetic behavioral data to enhance decision-making processes [5]. This framework's focus on distilling reasoning processes aligns with our approach of using structured forward-backward reasoning data to train models, emphasizing the importance of data-driven methods in reasoning enhancement.

In summary, the existing body of work highlights various strategies for improving reasoning in LLMs, ranging from structured reasoning modules and retrieval augmentation to modular thinking architectures and synthetic data distillation. Our REVTHINK framework contributes to this field by introducing reverse thinking as a novel approach to reasoning enhancement, demonstrating significant improvements in reasoning performance and sample efficiency. By integrating forward and backward reasoning tasks, REVTHINK not only enhances consistency checks but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, positioning it as a promising direction for future research in reasoning-augmented language models.","reverse thinking in AI, reasoning in large language models, data augmentation for reasoning, multi-task learning in language models","['Katherine M.

Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,2411.18627,"Data assimilation is a critical technique for improving the accuracy of predictions in complex dynamical systems, especially when dealing with chaotic behavior and sparse observations. Recent advancements in this field have focused on integrating machine learning and deep learning methodologies to enhance the performance of traditional data assimilation frameworks. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising techniques to infer initial conditions in chaotic systems without relying on ground truth data. Their approach utilizes differentiable simulation to systematically combine noisy observations with numerical models, demonstrating improved effectiveness over conventional data assimilation methods. This work highlights the potential of learning-based frameworks to address the challenges posed by chaotic dynamics, aligning with the broader trend of incorporating machine learning into data assimilation processes.

In parallel, Cheng et al. (2024) developed TorchDA, a Python package that integrates deep learning models within data assimilation workflows. This package supports various algorithms, including Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, and allows for flexible algorithm selection based on specific application requirements. TorchDA's ability to seamlessly combine data assimilation with deep neural networks provides a versatile tool for tackling complex high-dimensional systems, as evidenced by its enhanced performance in experiments with the Lorenz 63 and shallow water systems. The integration of deep learning representations within data assimilation frameworks, as demonstrated by TorchDA, underscores the growing interest in leveraging machine learning to handle the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional physical systems.

Xiao et al. (2024) introduced the Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF) methodology, which addresses the limitations of Ensemble Score Filters (EnSF) in scenarios with sparse observations. By performing data assimilation in a latent space, LD-EnSF avoids the costly evolution of full dynamics, significantly accelerating the assimilation process. The use of Latent Dynamics Networks (LDNets) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to encode sparse observations further enhances the robustness and accuracy of the method. This approach is particularly valuable for real-time data assimilation in complex dynamical systems, where fast and efficient processing is crucial. The LD-EnSF methodology exemplifies the innovative strategies being developed to improve data assimilation in high-dimensional and nonlinear problems, emphasizing the importance of latent space representations in modern data assimilation techniques.

The aforementioned works collectively illustrate the diverse strategies being employed to advance data assimilation in complex dynamical systems. My research contributes to this evolving landscape by introducing a novel data assimilation algorithm grounded in topological data analysis. Unlike traditional methods that require knowledge of measurement noise statistics, my approach leverages the differentiability of functions of persistence to optimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions. By focusing on the chaotic Lorenz system, my work demonstrates the capabilities and performance of this new method, offering a promising alternative for scenarios where noise information is unavailable or difficult to obtain.

"Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update
Processing",2411.19854v1,"The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various queuing and network systems. Recent research has focused on optimizing AoI in systems with different server configurations, including heterogeneous, tandem, and preemptive server setups. This section reviews relevant literature that informs our study on optimizing AoI in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps.

Bhati et al. (2021) investigate the AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers, where each server maintains a separate queue, and packets are randomly routed. Their work derives an exact expression for the average AoI in systems with two heterogeneous servers and provides an approximation useful for multi-server systems. They demonstrate that the average AoI decreases with the addition of more servers, highlighting the benefits of parallel processing in reducing AoI. This study is relevant to our work as it underscores the importance of server utilization in optimizing AoI, a concept we explore in our parallel server setups where multiple processors work concurrently to execute all computation steps (Bhati et al., 2021).

In a related vein, Sinha et al. (2024) examine the peak AoI in systems where information traverses through queues in tandem. Their recursive framework characterizes the mean peak AoI under both preemptive and non-preemptive policies, considering servers with different service rates. This work is particularly pertinent to our series server setups, where each processor performs a specific step in sequence. The insights from their study on the impact of server service rates on AoI inform our optimization problem, which seeks to determine optimal service rates under a power budget (Sinha et al., 2024).

Yates (2018) explores AoI in networks of preemptive servers, where updates follow a route through a series of nodes, each operating as a last-come-first-served queue. The study characterizes the average AoI at each node, showing how it accumulates through successive nodes. This work is relevant to our research as it highlights the challenges of managing AoI in series processing setups, where preemption can lead to wasted processing efforts. Our study builds on these findings by identifying scenarios where processing does not reduce AoI, such as when a fresher update preempts processing in series setups (Yates, 2018).

Our research extends the existing body of work by focusing on the age-power trade-off in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. While previous studies have primarily concentrated on optimizing AoI, our work introduces the dimension of power consumption, identifying instances of wasted power when processing efforts do not lead to a reduction in AoI. By formulating and solving an optimization problem to determine optimal service rates under a power budget, we provide a novel approach to balancing AoI performance with power efficiency.

A GEOMETRIC INVARIANT OF LINEAR RANK-METRIC CODES,2411.19087,"The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research due to their significant applications in various fields such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Hörmann, Bartz, and Puchinger (2022), who explored the error-erasure decoding of Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes in the sum-rank metric. Their research highlights the versatility of LRS codes, which encompass Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes as subclasses, and their ability to meet the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric. The authors introduced a novel error-erasure decoder that enhances the potential of LRS codes for multishot network coding, demonstrating its efficacy in correcting errors in the sum-subspace metric. This work underscores the importance of developing efficient decoding algorithms to leverage the full potential of rank-metric codes in practical applications.

In parallel, the exploration of subspace codes, which serve as the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming metric, has been extensively documented by Kurz (2021). Subspace codes are pivotal in random linear network coding and distributed storage, offering a robust framework for error correction in these settings. Kurz's survey of known constructions and upper bounds for subspace codes provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to enhance the performance and applicability of these codes. The insights from this work are instrumental in understanding the broader context of coding theory, particularly in relation to the algebraic structures and bounds that define the efficacy of various code families.

The intersection of these research efforts with our work lies in the shared goal of distinguishing and enhancing the capabilities of rank-metric codes. While Hörmann et al. focus on decoding strategies and Kurz on the structural aspects of subspace codes, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes. This invariant, inspired by the Schur product in the Hamming metric, offers a new perspective on differentiating Gabidulin codes from random ones. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code, we provide a geometric approach to understanding the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.

In conclusion, our work builds upon the foundational research of Hörmann et al. and Kurz by introducing a geometric invariant that enriches the toolkit for analyzing and distinguishing rank-metric codes. This contribution not only advances the theoretical understanding of these codes but also has potential implications for their practical applications in network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography.
