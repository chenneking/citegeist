{'related_works': "The exploration of epidemiological models through the lens of Petri nets has garnered significant attention in recent research, as evidenced by several studies that align with and complement the objectives of this work. Trevor Reckell et al. (2024) demonstrate the numerical equivalence of Petri net SIR models to classical ODE formulations, underscoring the efficacy of Petri nets in modeling SIR-type dynamics with minimal error. This numerical approach complements our geometric interpretation of the next-generation matrix, as both studies emphasize the potential of Petri nets to extend traditional epidemiological models. Similarly, P. Hernández et al. (2020) extend the SEIR model by incorporating arbitrary distributions of incubation and removal times, which parallels our work's focus on generalizing epidemiological models using Petri nets. Their approach to modeling the basic reproduction number, R0, in a homogeneous population complements our geometric interpretation of R0 through Petri nets, highlighting the versatility of Petri nets in enhancing the understanding of complex epidemic processes.\n\nThe integration of network models into epidemiological studies offers a broader perspective on disease dynamics, as highlighted by Edward Rusu (2015) and Joel C. Miller and Erik M. Volz (2011). Rusu contrasts traditional compartmental models with network models, addressing limitations such as the mass-action assumption and proposing network models to account for social structures and individual variability in disease spread. This aligns with our research, which extends compartmental models using Petri nets to incorporate additional complexities like vertical transmission. Miller and Volz's exploration of edge-based compartmental models for infectious disease spread, focusing on static and dynamic network structures, further complements our work by adapting mean-field SIR models to network contexts. Both studies emphasize the importance of network structures and heterogeneities in understanding epidemic spread, which resonates with our geometric interpretation of the next-generation matrix.\n\nThe mathematical frameworks for understanding transitions and interactions within compartments are crucial for advancing epidemiological modeling. Wout Merbis (2021) presents a framework for deriving exact transition rate matrices for stochastic systems on networks, which aligns with our work by providing a mathematical structure related to the geometric interpretation of epidemiological models using Petri nets. This approach complements our exploration of flow matrices in infection compartments, offering a broader perspective on modeling epidemic processes. Similarly, Florin Avram et al. (2021) discuss matrix SIR or SYR models, characterized by their division into susceptible, diseased, and output groups, similar to the classic SIR model. Their emphasis on matrix-based approaches complements our geometric perspective, offering a different yet related framework for analyzing epidemiological models.\n\nThe need for generalized frameworks to address complex epidemiological dynamics is further highlighted by Àlex Giménez-Romero et al. (2022) and Rosanna C. Barnard et al. (2018). Giménez-Romero et al. explore the limitations of traditional methods for calculating the basic reproduction number, R0, in vector-borne disease models with non-stationary vector populations, offering alternative approaches when standard methods fail. This aligns with our work by emphasizing the importance of model reduction and parameter identifiability, paralleling our approach of using Petri nets to extend compartmental models. Barnard et al. validate the basic reproduction number through network attributes and simulations, complementing our geometric interpretation of the next-generation matrix and highlighting the significance of structural insights in epidemiological modeling.\n\nFinally, the foundational role of the SIR model in understanding disease transmission dynamics is emphasized by Helena Sofia Rodrigues (2016) and Zhongpu Xu and Xinchu Fu (2017). Rodrigues explores the application of the SIR epidemiological model across various fields, aligning with our research, which extends the SIR model's basic structures using Petri nets to generalize the concept of the basic reproduction number. Xu and Fu's exploration of epidemic spreading on one-way circular-coupled networks provides insights into the role of network topology in epidemic dynamics, complementing our geometric approach to understanding the basic reproduction number through Petri nets. Both studies underscore the importance of structural components in modeling and analyzing epidemic spread, reinforcing the relevance of our research in advancing the understanding of epidemiological models.", 'citations': ['Trevor Reckell, Beckett Sterner, Petar Jevtić, Reggie Davidrajuh (2024).
