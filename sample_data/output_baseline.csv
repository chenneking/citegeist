10,8|7|7|6|7|7|8|7|7|7,"In recent years, the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of code understanding and generation has garnered significant attention. Traditional benchmarks, such as HumanEval, have been instrumental in assessing the capabilities of these models. However, they often fall short in capturing the nuanced aspects of code reasoning and execution tracing. Zhao et al. (2024) introduce CodeJudge-Eval, a benchmark that shifts focus from mere code generation to evaluating the correctness of code solutions, thereby highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks in assessing true code comprehension. This aligns with our findings, which demonstrate that LLMs, despite their proficiency in generating semantically identical code, struggle with tracing execution paths and understanding advanced code structures. Similarly, Zheng et al. (2024) emphasize the need for multidimensional assessments beyond correctness, as their RACE benchmark evaluates code quality across multiple dimensions, including readability and maintainability, underscoring the importance of comprehensive evaluation metrics.

The limitations of current benchmarks are further explored by Xu et al. (2024) and Zhuo et al. (2024), who address biases and challenges in existing evaluations. Xu et al. introduce CRUXEVAL-X, a multilingual code reasoning benchmark that addresses the programming language and task biases prevalent in benchmarks like HumanEval. This is particularly relevant to our work, as it underscores the need for diverse and comprehensive benchmarks to better assess LLMs' coding capabilities, including structural control flow understanding. Zhuo et al. present BigCodeBench, which evaluates LLMs' ability to perform complex tasks involving multiple function calls across various libraries and domains. Both studies reveal that current LLMs struggle with tasks requiring advanced reasoning and structural comprehension, echoing our findings on the limitations of LLMs in understanding and executing complex code structures.

The importance of structured data in enhancing code reasoning abilities is highlighted by Grossman et al. (2023), who emphasize the limitations of relying solely on unstructured code representations. By leveraging the LLVM compiler infrastructure to create a dataset of intermediate representations, they provide a foundation for improving code reasoning abilities, which is crucial for addressing the challenges identified in our study. This aligns with Song et al. (2024), who propose the BESTER algorithm to enhance LLMs' debugging capabilities through self-reflection, potentially improving performance on benchmarks like CoCoNUT by enabling better code reasoning and error correction. Both works complement our research by providing methods to enhance LLMs' understanding of code structure and control flow.

The need for robust evaluation methods is further underscored by Allamanis et al. (2024) and Riddell et al. (2024). Allamanis et al. introduce round-trip correctness (RTC) as an alternative evaluation method, allowing assessment across a broader spectrum of real-world software domains without costly human curation. This approach contrasts with traditional benchmarks like HumanEval, which are limited in scope. Riddell et al. investigate data contamination in code generation benchmarks, highlighting the overlap between these benchmarks and pretraining data, which can lead to inflated model performance. Both studies emphasize the need for more robust evaluation methods to ensure the reliability and generalization of LLMs in programming tasks, resonating with our findings on the limitations of current benchmarks.

In summary, the body of related work collectively underscores the limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating LLMs' comprehensive coding abilities, particularly in understanding and executing complex code structures. Our research contributes to this discourse by introducing the CoCoNUT benchmark, which specifically addresses the gaps in current evaluations by focusing on the structural control flow of code. By highlighting the challenges LLMs face in tracing execution paths and handling advanced programming structures, our work, in conjunction with the related studies, emphasizes the need for more comprehensive and diverse evaluation methods to enhance LLMs' code reasoning capabilities and better support real-world software development tasks.","Miltiadis Allamanis, Sheena Panthaplackel, Pengcheng Yin (2024).

10,8|8|8|6|5|6|3|8|7|4,"The increasing importance of privacy in machine learning (ML) deployment has led to a growing body of research focused on ensuring the confidentiality and verifiability of ML models and their inferences. A significant portion of this research has explored the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to address these challenges. For instance, Xing et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive survey of zero-knowledge proof-based verifiable machine learning (ZKP-VML) technology, which addresses trustworthiness issues in outsourced model training and inference. This aligns with our focus on ensuring privacy and verifiability in distributed ML inference using zkSNARKs, as both approaches aim to enhance trust among participants in distributed ML environments (Xing et al., 2023). Similarly, Kang et al. (2022) present a method for non-interactively verifying ML model inference using ZK-SNARKs, achieving practical verification for large-scale models. This work parallels our research by employing zkSNARKs to ensure verifiable ML inference, although our approach specifically maintains partial privacy of model parameters during distributed inference (Kang et al., 2022).

In the realm of commitment verification, Lycklama et al. (2024) introduce CP-SNARK constructions, such as Apollo and Artemis, which significantly reduce prover costs and improve efficiency in verifying commitments within zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) pipelines. These advancements are crucial for enhancing the feasibility and scalability of our proposed solution, particularly for larger models in edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned ML models (Lycklama et al., 2024). Additionally, South et al. (2024) extend the concept of verifiable inference to model evaluation, allowing end-users to confirm model performance and fairness without accessing private weights. Both approaches leverage zkSNARKs to enhance transparency and trust, underscoring a shared goal of improving the reliability of ML models in various deployment scenarios (South et al., 2024).

Privacy concerns in ML inference have also been addressed through different methodologies. Nawaz et al. (2020) propose Otak, which enables two non-colluding cloud providers to perform inference without knowing the inputs, using a novel 2PC protocol. This contrasts with our work, which focuses on the privacy of model parameters during inference using zkSNARKs, allowing selective model section revelation (Nawaz et al., 2020). Similarly, Malekzadeh and Gunduz (2022) highlight the risks associated with inference-time data exposure, emphasizing the importance of protecting model parameters during inference. Our research complements this by extending the privacy focus to model parameters, proposing zkSNARKs for verifiable and tamper-proof inference (Malekzadeh & Gunduz, 2022).

In the context of federated learning (FL), Zhu et al. (2023) propose RiseFL, a solution that enhances efficiency in secure data collaboration using zero-knowledge proofs. While our work focuses on ensuring partial privacy of model parameters during distributed ML inference, the efficiency improvements in RiseFL could inform future optimizations in our approach to support larger models (Zhu et al., 2023). Additionally, Yadav et al. (2024) introduce a system that leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs to verify the fairness of ML models while maintaining their confidentiality, addressing consumer distrust in model predictions. This relates to our work by highlighting the use of cryptographic techniques, specifically zkSNARKs, to ensure privacy and trust in ML models (Yadav et al., 2024).

Overall, the related works collectively underscore the critical role of zero-knowledge proofs in enhancing privacy and verifiability in ML deployments. While various approaches address different aspects of privacy, such as input data protection, model evaluation, and federated learning, our research uniquely focuses on the privacy of model parameters during distributed inference. By employing zkSNARKs, we aim to achieve verifiable and tamper-proof inference across trusted and untrusted nodes, thereby contributing to the broader goal of improving trust and privacy in distributed ML systems.","Tobin South, Alexander Camuto, Shrey Jain, Shayla Nguyen, Robert Mahari, Christian Paquin, Jason Morton, Alex 'Sandy' Pentland (2024).

10,9|8|8|8|8|8|8|8|8|9,"The exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the context of adapting the Transformer architecture for natural language processing (NLP). A comprehensive survey by Hu et al. (2024) provides a foundational understanding of the development of deep SNNs, with a focus on Spiking Transformers. This work categorizes learning methods into ANN-to-SNN conversion and direct training with surrogate gradients, which is directly relevant to the challenges addressed in our research on SpikeDecoder, a spike-based Transformer decoder for NLP. The survey's insights into network architectures, including Transformer-based SNNs, align with our efforts to develop energy-efficient SNN adaptations of the Transformer model (Hu et al., 2024).

Several studies have made strides in applying SNNs to language tasks, highlighting the potential of spike-driven models in this domain. Xing et al. (2024) introduce SpikeLM, a fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, which employs a novel bi-spiking mechanism to encode semantic information. This work parallels our research by demonstrating the viability of spike-driven models in language processing and bridging the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. Similarly, Knipper et al. (2024) explore encoding methods for text into spike trains, achieving significant energy efficiency improvements, which complements our investigation into spike-compatible text embedding methods for the SpikeDecoder model (Xing et al., 2024; Knipper et al., 2024).

The challenge of maintaining accuracy in SNNs compared to their ANN counterparts is addressed in several studies. You et al. (2024) present SpikeZIP-TF, an ANN-to-SNN conversion method that achieves equivalent accuracy between ANN and SNN models, particularly in NLP tasks. This work supports our goal of developing SpikeDecoder by demonstrating the potential of SNNs to achieve high efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, Lv et al. (2023) introduce SpikeBERT, which uses a two-stage knowledge distillation method to address the performance gap with transformer-based models like BERT. These studies underscore the potential of SNNs in NLP, aligning with our efforts to create a fully spike-based Transformer decoder model (You et al., 2024; Lv et al., 2023).

The integration of SNNs with Transformers has been explored through various methodologies, each contributing to the enhancement of energy efficiency. Wang et al. (2022) introduce a Masked Spiking Transformer framework with Random Spike Masking, which contrasts with our direct training approach for a spike-based Transformer decoder. This work, along with Bal et al. (2024), which develops a binary/ternary spiking language model architecture, highlights alternative methods to optimize energy efficiency in SNN-based models. Both studies complement our research by emphasizing the importance of reducing energy consumption while maintaining model effectiveness (Wang et al., 2022; Bal et al., 2024).

In the broader context of spiking neural networks and their application to NLP, our work on SpikeDecoder contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop energy-efficient models by proposing a fully spike-based Transformer decoder. This research builds on the foundational insights provided by previous studies, such as the exploration of spike-driven mechanisms and encoding methods, while addressing the unique challenges of training and maintaining accuracy in SNNs. By focusing on the integration of spike-compatible components and energy-efficient embedding methods, our work extends the application of spike-based models to NLP tasks, offering a promising direction for future research in energy-efficient neural network architectures (Zhu et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023).","Man Yao, Jiakui Hu, Zhaokun Zhou, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian, Bo Xu, Guoqi Li (2023).

10,8|8|8|8|8|8|8|8|8|8,"The exploration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video understanding has gained significant traction, with various studies addressing the challenges and opportunities in this domain. A common theme among recent works is the extension of image-based LLMs to video contexts, leveraging pre-trained models to enhance video comprehension. Tingyu Qu et al. (2024) introduce a Thumbnail-and-Sampling strategy to construct visual tokens, which aligns with our approach of enhancing instruction diversity for video LLMs. Their training-free method contrasts with our fine-tuning approach using synthesized video-like samples, yet both aim to improve video understanding by utilizing pre-trained image LLMs. Similarly, Suyuan Huang et al. (2024) present RED-VILLM, a resource-efficient pipeline that builds on foundational image LLM capabilities to optimize video understanding, emphasizing efficient data utilization and instruction diversity, akin to our T2Vid method.

Addressing the challenge of long video understanding, Hongchen Wei and Zhenzhong Chen (2024) propose extending the visual context window in LMMs, eliminating the need for retraining on extensive datasets. This complements our research, which also seeks to enhance video understanding by improving instruction diversity and training efficiency. Our data augmentation method to synthesize video-like samples parallels their focus on optimizing context windows and memory usage. Additionally, Jiajun Liu et al. (2024) introduce Kangaroo, a Video LMM designed to process long videos, emphasizing high-quality data curation and instruction diversity. Our T2Vid approach shares this focus, synthesizing video-like samples to improve training efficiency, highlighting a shared commitment to optimizing data utilization for video LMMs.

The integration of visual and textual data is another focal point in advancing video understanding. Kirolos Ataallah et al. (2024) present MiniGPT4-Video, which processes sequences of frames and incorporates textual conversations, achieving state-of-the-art results. While our work identifies limitations in zero-shot inference and explores fine-tuning with synthesized samples, MiniGPT4-Video emphasizes the integration of visual and textual data. This approach is complemented by Huanjin Yao et al. (2024), who introduce the Dense Connector, enhancing MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features. Both studies underscore the potential of visual encoders and data integration in achieving zero-shot video understanding, offering complementary methodologies to our focus on efficient training with reduced sample sizes.

The importance of instruction diversity and efficient data utilization is further highlighted by Yang Jin et al. (2024), who propose a unified generative pre-training framework across videos, images, and text. Their method of efficient video decomposition and tokenization complements our exploration of fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs for video understanding, particularly in addressing temporal understanding limitations. Kanchana Ranasinghe et al. (2024) also explore the influence of LLMs' world knowledge and reasoning skills on long-video understanding, revealing high accuracy with limited video information. While their focus is on integrating object-centric information using vision tools, our approach emphasizes efficient training with synthesized samples, achieving comparable performance.

In the broader context of advancing MLLMs for video understanding, Heqing Zou et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive survey of the challenges in this field, particularly emphasizing the need for models to handle fine-grained spatiotemporal details and long-term dependencies. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing a data augmentation method that enhances instruction diversity, improving learning efficiency and performance in long video understanding without extensive datasets. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of innovative data augmentation and instruction synthesis techniques in advancing MLLMs for complex video tasks, situating our research within a broader effort to optimize video understanding capabilities.","Tingyu Qu, Mingxiao Li, Tinne Tuytelaars, Marie-Francine Moens (2024).

10,8|5|6|7|8|7|7|5|7|7,"The field of enhancing reasoning capabilities in language models has seen significant advancements, with various methodologies proposed to improve the generalization and robustness of these models. A prominent approach is the distillation of reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller student models. Chengwei Dai et al. (2024) introduce Cascading Decomposed CoTs Distillation (CasCoD), which restructures training objectives to focus on learning rationales without preset answers, thereby mitigating spurious correlations and enhancing reasoning generalizability (Dai et al., 2024). This approach aligns with the goals of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework, which also seeks to improve reasoning capabilities in student models, albeit through structured forward-backward reasoning. Similarly, Yiwei Li et al. (2023) emphasize the importance of incorporating negative samples in the distillation process to enhance model specialization, providing insights that could be integrated into REVTHINK for further refinement (Li et al., 2023).

Another significant theme in the literature is the integration of contextual knowledge and dynamic reasoning strategies to enhance model performance. Zeming Chen et al. (2023) propose RECKONING, a method that integrates contextual knowledge into transformer-based models to improve robustness against distractor facts, addressing the challenge of spurious reasoning in in-context scenarios (Chen et al., 2023). This complements REVTHINK's focus on augmenting reasoning capabilities through reverse thinking strategies. Additionally, Kaituo Feng et al. (2024) introduce KPOD, which enhances the distillation process by focusing on token significance and learning order, highlighting the importance of structured reasoning processes in model training (Feng et al., 2024). Both RECKONING and KPOD share a common goal with REVTHINK in improving reasoning performance, albeit through different mechanisms.

The exploration of diverse reasoning capabilities, such as lateral and reflective thinking, is also a critical area of research. Yifan Jiang et al. (2023) introduce BRAINTEASER, a benchmark designed to evaluate lateral thinking in language models, which complements the reverse thinking approach in REVTHINK by emphasizing the need for diverse reasoning capabilities (Jiang et al., 2023). Similarly, Zhihan Zhang et al. (2024) propose reflective augmentation, a technique that embeds problem reflection into training instances to promote alternative perspectives and reflective reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024). Both studies underscore the importance of moving beyond traditional reasoning tasks to improve model performance and consistency, aligning with REVTHINK's emphasis on integrating forward and backward thinking.

The challenge of reversing thinking patterns is further explored in the work of Jinwei He and Feng Lu (2024), who introduce CauseJudger (CJ), a framework for abductive logical reasoning that transforms reverse to forward reasoning and removes irrelevant information (He & Lu, 2024). This aligns with the reverse thinking concept in REVTHINK, as both approaches demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning tasks by leveraging reverse thinking methodologies. Additionally, Aaron Chan et al. (2022) present KNIFE, a method for distilling reasoning knowledge from free-text rationales into smaller models, which, like REVTHINK, aims to enhance reasoning capabilities through innovative training techniques (Chan et al., 2022).

In summary, the landscape of reasoning enhancement in language models is rich with diverse methodologies, each contributing unique insights and techniques. REVTHINK stands out by integrating structured forward-backward reasoning to improve reasoning performance and generalization in student models. While other approaches, such as CasCoD, RECKONING, and KPOD, focus on different aspects like rationale learning, contextual knowledge integration, and token significance, they collectively highlight the multifaceted nature of reasoning enhancement. By situating REVTHINK within this broader context, it becomes evident that leveraging reverse thinking strategies offers a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of language models, complementing and extending the existing body of research.","Yiwei Li, Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Boyuan Pan, Bin Sun, Xinglin Wang, Heda Wang, Kan Li (2023).

10,6|7|7|7|5|5|5|7|4|7,"The exploration of commitment mechanisms in strategic communication has been a focal point in recent research, with various studies examining different facets of Bayesian persuasion. A significant body of work has investigated the role of commitment in multi-sender environments, where the dynamics of sender-receiver interactions are complex and nuanced. For instance, Shih-Tang Su and Vijay G. Subramanian (2022) delve into the impact of sequential commitments in Bayesian persuasion games, emphasizing how the order of commitment influences equilibrium payoffs and strategies. This study underscores the importance of commitment power, a concept central to my research on money-burning tactics for enhancing commitment in communication models (Su & Subramanian, 2022). Similarly, Ronen Gradwohl et al. (2020) explore a Bayesian persuasion model with multiple senders, highlighting the receiver's role in capturing informational surplus when senders are uncertain about each other's preferences. While my work focuses on a single sender's use of money-burning to improve payoffs, these studies provide a broader context for understanding commitment mechanisms in communication models, including those applicable to Web 3.0 communities (Gradwohl et al., 2020).

The challenge of maintaining sender credibility in Bayesian persuasion is another critical area of research. Jiahao Zhang et al. (2023) introduce ex-post individually rational (ex-post IR) policies to ensure that senders do not send signals leading to worse outcomes than no disclosure, thereby maintaining credibility. This concept is relevant to my research as it highlights the importance of credible commitment in communication mechanisms, akin to the money-burning tactics I explore (Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, Yeon-Koo Che et al. (2020) examine a dynamic model of Bayesian persuasion where information generation and processing are costly, and neither party can commit to future actions, potentially leading to a collapse of persuasion in equilibrium. This contrasts with my work, which focuses on mediated communication enhanced by money-burning tactics to achieve commitment power (Che et al., 2020).

The role of mediators and platforms in facilitating communication without commitment has also been explored in recent studies. Itai Arieli et al. (2022) examine an information design problem involving two informed senders and a receiver, where senders lack commitment power. This highlights the role of a mediator in communication, contrasting with my research, which focuses on enhancing commitment through money-burning tactics (Arieli et al., 2022). Furthermore, Itai Arieli et al. (2023) introduce a two-stage Bayesian persuasion model where a third-party platform controls information disclosure to optimize user utility. This study contrasts with my work, where the sender directly designs communication mechanisms with money-burning tactics for commitment, offering insights into platform-mediated information control and reputation management (Arieli et al., 2023).

The constraints and potential of communication mechanisms in persuasion have been addressed by Maël Le Treust and Tristan Tomala (2017), who examine a Bayesian persuasion problem where communication occurs through an imperfect channel with limited messages and exogenous noise. This study provides an upper bound on the persuader's achievable payoffs, complementing my exploration of money-burning tactics to enhance commitment power (Le Treust & Tomala, 2017). Additionally, You Zu et al. (2021) highlight the importance of robust Bayesian persuasion in online platforms, where the sender must learn and persuade simultaneously without prior knowledge of the distribution. This emphasis on robustness under uncertainty complements my model's application to Web 3.0 communities, where commitment value is crucial (Zu et al., 2021).

In summary, the existing literature on Bayesian persuasion and strategic communication provides a rich tapestry of insights into the dynamics of commitment, credibility, and communication mechanisms. My research contributes to this discourse by introducing money-burning tactics as a novel approach to enhancing commitment power in communication models, particularly within the context of Web 3.0 communities. By situating my work within the broader landscape of related studies, I aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of how commitment strategies can be optimized to improve sender payoffs and align receiver actions with sender preferences.","Shih-Tang Su, Vijay G.

10,3|6|8|3|7|4|2|5|8|8,"The study of Condorcet extensions and their susceptibility to paradoxes is a rich area of research within voting theory, with numerous works exploring the inherent challenges and potential solutions. A significant theme in the literature is the tension between maintaining fairness conditions, such as anonymity and neutrality, and the susceptibility of voting rules to paradoxes. Holliday et al. (2022) delve into this tension by examining the challenges of binary expansion consistency and resoluteness, using SAT solving and formal verification to address impossibility theorems. This work is particularly relevant to my research as it highlights the difficulties in designing voting rules that are both fair and immune to paradoxes like the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes (Holliday et al., 2022). Similarly, Xia (2021) explores the incompatibility of the Condorcet criterion with other voting desiderata, emphasizing the challenges faced by Condorcet extensions in avoiding paradoxical outcomes (Xia, 2021).

Another critical aspect of the literature is the exploration of Condorcet-consistent voting rules and their vulnerabilities. Peters (2017) demonstrates that every Condorcet-consistent voting rule is susceptible to manipulation when there are at least four alternatives, complementing my investigation into the vulnerabilities of Condorcet extensions to paradoxes in three-candidate elections (Peters, 2017). This connection underscores the broader challenges faced by Condorcet-consistent rules and the importance of exploring refinements like maximin, which I identify as immune to certain paradoxes. Darlington (2017) reinforces the necessity of Condorcet consistency in voting systems, arguing for majority rule as the standard for two-candidate elections due to its reliability and resistance to strategic manipulation (Darlington, 2017). This work relates to my research by highlighting the challenges faced by alternative systems that lack Condorcet consistency and the potential solutions offered by refinements of maximin.

The exploration of axiomatic characterizations and their implications is another prominent theme in the literature. Krukowski (2023) extends May's classical theorem by introducing the concept of ""reducibility to subsocieties,"" providing a broader context for understanding the conditions under which majority rule can be applied (Krukowski, 2023). This exploration complements my investigation into the axiomatic characterizations of voting rules immune to paradoxes, such as maximin and its refinements. Similarly, Sánchez-Fernández and Fisteus (2017) examine monotonicity axioms in approval-based multi-winner voting rules, addressing the robustness of voting rules to paradoxes and axiomatic constraints (Sánchez-Fernández & Fisteus, 2017). Both studies contribute to the discourse on the compatibility of voting rules with desirable axiomatic properties.

The probabilistic aspects of Condorcet winners are also explored in the literature, providing a foundational backdrop for understanding the broader implications of Condorcet extensions. Krishnamoorthy and Raghavachari (2005) offer mathematical insights into the probability of a Condorcet winner existing as the number of candidates increases, which is crucial for understanding the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to paradoxes (Krishnamoorthy & Raghavachari, 2005). This probabilistic perspective complements my exploration of paradox immunity in specific voting rules like maximin. Additionally, Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine (2024) explore the concept of Condorcet winning sets, offering a complementary approach to achieving majority preference in elections (Elkind et al., 2024).

In summary, the related works collectively underscore the complexities and challenges faced by Condorcet extensions in maintaining fairness and avoiding paradoxical outcomes. My research contributes to this discourse by specifically investigating the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in three-candidate elections. By identifying refinements of maximin as potential solutions, my work aligns with the broader literature's emphasis on exploring refinements and axiomatic characterizations to achieve desirable properties in voting rules. The insights from these related works provide a comprehensive context for understanding the limitations and potential improvements in the design of Condorcet extensions.","Luis Sánchez-Fernández, Jesús A.

10,7|7|7|8|7|7|8|7|8|7,"The study of chaotic dynamics and diffusion in coupled map lattices has been a subject of extensive research, with various models exploring the intricate interplay between chaos and transport properties. In the context of coupled cat maps, our work builds upon and diverges from several key studies in the field. Henok Tenaw Moges et al. (2021) and Mirella Harsoula and George Contopoulos (2018) both delve into the diffusion transport and chaos properties of standard maps, examining how specific configurations of coupling can influence diffusion behavior. While Moges et al. focus on suppressing anomalous transport to achieve normal diffusion, Harsoula and Contopoulos highlight the role of accelerator mode islands in causing ballistic motion. These studies provide a comparative framework for understanding the diffusion mechanisms in our lattice model, where chaos-induced fluctuations lead to diffusive transport in phase space, emphasizing the role of microscopic chaos in macroscopic diffusion behavior.

The role of coupling in chaotic dynamics is further explored in the works of Mario Mulansky et al. (2011) and Alessandro Torcini and Stefano Lepri (1996). Mulansky et al. investigate chaos in one-dimensional nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices, finding that chaos is proportional to coupling strength and lattice length, with Lyapunov exponents linked to triplet resonances. This provides a broader context for understanding chaos-induced diffusion, complementing our findings on diffusive transport due to microscopic chaos. Torcini and Lepri, on the other hand, focus on the propagation of localized perturbations in chaotic coupled map lattices with long-range couplings, highlighting the role of Lyapunov exponents in both exponential and ballistic propagation scenarios. Their study contrasts with our examination of local perturbations, offering insights into different coupling regimes and their impact on chaotic transport.

The exploration of Lyapunov exponents and vectors is crucial for analyzing chaotic dynamics, as demonstrated in the works of Johnathon Barbish and Mark Paul (2023) and P. Muruganandam and M. Senthilvelan (2021). Barbish and Paul utilize covariant Lyapunov vectors to quantify high-dimensional chaos in diffusively coupled tent maps, providing insights into the behavior of Lyapunov exponents and vectors essential for our model of coupled cat maps. Muruganandam and Senthilvelan focus on the spatial spread of out-of-time-ordered correlators in coupled map lattices, employing finite-time Lyapunov exponents to explore the dynamics. Both studies address the spread of perturbations in chaotic systems, complementing our investigation of Lyapunov exponents in coupled cat maps and informing the understanding of diffusive transport in our model.

The theoretical foundation for understanding chaotic dynamics and ergodic properties in coupled cat maps is further enriched by the works of Minos Axenides et al. (2022) and Xu-Yao Hu and Vladimir Rosenhaus (2022). Axenides et al. construct Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, focusing on the chaotic properties of these systems through symplectic group evolution operators. Their work highlights the spatio-temporal chaos and the role of unstable periodic orbits, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms of chaos-driven diffusion observed in our study. Hu and Rosenhaus provide a detailed analysis of correlation functions in chaotic maps, including the cat map, using methods such as Fourier expansion. Their study aligns with our investigation of ergodic properties and diffusive transport in phase space, offering foundational insights into the behavior of chaotic systems.

Finally, the impact of local perturbations on global dynamics is explored in the works of Kunihiko Kaneko (1993) and Stefan Groote and Christian Beck (2006). Kaneko investigates the role of local phase slips in coupled map lattices, revealing how such perturbations can lead to the coexistence of attractors with different velocities. This is relevant to our work, as it highlights the significance of microscopic chaos in determining macroscopic transport properties. Groote and Beck explore diffusively coupled Tchebyscheff maps, focusing on non-hyperbolic maps and their unique scaling behavior. Their study complements our research by providing insights into the behavior of coupled chaotic systems, particularly in understanding how microscopic chaos can lead to diffusive transport in phase space.

In summary, our research on the lattice of coupled cat maps contributes to the broader understanding of chaotic dynamics and diffusion in coupled map lattices. By examining the ergodic properties and ballistic spread of perturbations leading to diffusive transport, our work aligns with and diverges from existing studies, offering new insights into the role of microscopic chaos in macroscopic diffusion behavior. The related works provide a rich context for our findings, highlighting the diverse mechanisms through which chaos influences transport properties in complex systems.","Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos, Stam Nicolis (2022).

10,7|8|8|8|8|8|8|8|8|7,"In recent years, the integration of machine learning and data assimilation has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the prediction accuracy of chaotic dynamical systems. Several studies have explored various methodologies to address the inherent challenges posed by noise and partial observations. For instance, Frerix et al. (2021) introduced a variational data assimilation method that learns a mapping from observational data to physical states, thereby refining the initialization process and improving prediction accuracy in chaotic systems like the Lorenz model. This approach shares a common goal with my research, which also seeks to enhance prediction accuracy by refining data assimilation processes, albeit through a novel topological data analysis-based algorithm. Similarly, Nguyen et al. (2019) employed a Bayesian approach using neural networks to infer hidden dynamics and model parameters, complementing my work by addressing noise and sampling issues without relying on noise statistics.

Deep learning techniques have also been leveraged to improve data assimilation schemes, as demonstrated by Bocquet et al. (2024), who utilized a residual convolutional neural network to enhance the analysis step of sequential data assimilation. This method aligns with my research's focus on improving predictions in chaotic systems without traditional noise statistics, though it employs deep learning rather than topological data analysis. Additionally, McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced amortized assimilation, which enhances data assimilation by learning from sequences of noisy observations without requiring ground truth data. This approach parallels my research's aim to optimize predictions in the presence of noise and incomplete data, highlighting complementary strategies for enhancing data assimilation in complex systems.

Hybrid approaches that combine data assimilation with machine learning have been explored to emulate and predict chaotic dynamics. Brajard et al. (2020) demonstrated a method using an ensemble Kalman filter and a neural network to iteratively update a surrogate model, akin to my use of topological data analysis for model tuning. This shared interest in enhancing data-driven models for complex dynamical systems is further echoed by Gottwald and Reich (2020), who employed random feature maps within an ensemble Kalman filter to sequentially learn from noisy observations. Both studies, like mine, aim to improve predictions in chaotic systems, though they integrate machine learning with traditional data assimilation techniques to achieve computational efficiency and probabilistic forecasting.

The challenge of parameter recovery in chaotic systems has been addressed by Carlson et al. (2021), who developed an algorithm for dynamically learning parameters from partial observations. While their focus is on parameter recovery, my research introduces a data assimilation algorithm using topological data analysis to optimize model predictions without relying on noise statistics. This distinction highlights the diverse methodologies employed to tackle similar challenges in chaotic systems. Furthermore, Wikner et al. (2021) explored the integration of machine learning and data assimilation to enhance forecast capabilities, employing the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter for data assimilation. This approach aligns with my research's goal of improving predictions without relying on noise statistics, though it utilizes a different data assimilation technique.

In summary, the landscape of data assimilation and machine learning for chaotic dynamical systems is rich with diverse methodologies, each addressing the challenges of noise, partial observations, and prediction accuracy in unique ways. My research contributes to this field by introducing a novel data assimilation algorithm based on topological data analysis, which optimizes model predictions without relying on noise statistics. This approach complements existing studies by offering an alternative methodology that leverages the differentiability of functions of persistence and gradient descent optimization. Collectively, these works underscore the potential of integrating machine learning and data assimilation to advance the accuracy and reliability of predictions in complex dynamical systems.","Thomas Frerix, Dmitrii Kochkov, Jamie A.

10,5|7|4|2|7|3|7|6|6|2,"The exploration of the Age of Information (AoI) in systems with sequential processing steps has garnered significant attention in recent research, particularly in the context of optimizing power consumption while maintaining system performance. A foundational aspect of this research is the power-performance relationship in computing systems, as examined by Yanpei Liu, Stark C. Draper, and Nam Sung Kim (2013). Their queuing theoretic approach identifies optimal processing speeds and system settings for power efficiency, which aligns with our focus on balancing the age-power trade-off in systems with sequential processing steps. Both studies emphasize the necessity of efficient power management strategies to optimize system performance, especially in scenarios involving multiple servers or processing steps (Liu et al., 2013).

The trade-off between update quality and processing time is another critical theme in AoI research. Melih Bastopcu and Sennur Ulukus (2019) investigate this trade-off in information update systems, highlighting the importance of balancing processing speed and update quality. This is closely related to our work, which addresses the age-power trade-off in systems with sequential processing steps. Both studies aim to optimize system performance by determining optimal processing strategies under specific constraints, such as power budgets or quality requirements (Bastopcu & Ulukus, 2019). Similarly, Ajay Badita et al. (2021) focus on energy minimization in data-intensive applications across multiple servers, paralleling our exploration of the age-power trade-off. While they use probabilistic speed selection to manage energy, our research optimizes service rates to balance age and power, underscoring a shared interest in optimizing system performance under power constraints (Badita et al., 2021).

Efficient power management in computational systems is further explored by Daniele Cesarini et al. (2018, 2019) through the introduction of COUNTDOWN, a runtime library that reduces power usage without significantly increasing execution time. This approach to managing power during idle times complements our exploration of the age-power trade-off in processing updates, highlighting the importance of minimizing wasted power while maintaining performance (Cesarini et al., 2018; Cesarini et al., 2019). Additionally, Ismail Akturk and Ulya R. Karpuzcu (2017) explore the trade-off between computation and communication, emphasizing that recomputing data can be more energy-efficient than storing and retrieving precomputed data. This aligns with our research on optimizing processing steps to manage the age-power trade-off, as both works emphasize strategic resource allocation to enhance energy efficiency (Akturk & Karpuzcu, 2017).

The challenge of maintaining information freshness while managing power constraints is addressed by Parisa Rafiee et al. (2020) in their study of power-efficient edge computing systems. Their focus on a tandem computation-transmission queue model, where sensor nodes manage power constraints while maintaining AoI, is relevant to our research on the age-power trade-off in systems requiring sequential processing steps. Both studies highlight the importance of optimizing service rates and power usage to minimize AoI, emphasizing the need for efficient power management to enhance system performance in terms of information freshness (Rafiee et al., 2020). Furthermore, Rajat Talak and Eytan Modiano (2019) investigate the trade-off between AoI and delay in an M server system, underscoring the complexity of optimizing AoI in systems with multiple processing steps. This is similar to our exploration of age-power trade-offs in parallel and series server setups, as both studies emphasize the challenges in balancing system performance metrics, such as AoI, with other factors like delay and power consumption (Talak & Modiano, 2019).

In summary, the related works collectively underscore the multifaceted nature of optimizing AoI in systems with sequential processing steps, particularly in the context of power management. Our research contributes to this body of work by specifically addressing the age-power trade-off in both parallel and series server setups, formulating and solving an optimization problem to determine the optimal service rates for each processing step under a given power budget. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, our study extends the insights from these related works, offering a nuanced understanding of the interplay between processing speed, power consumption, and information freshness in computational systems.","Melih Bastopcu, Sennur Ulukus (2019).

10,8|8|8|7|8|8|7|9|8|7,"The study of rank-metric codes has garnered significant attention due to their applicability in various domains such as network coding, distributed storage, and post-quantum cryptography. A central theme in recent research is the development of new families of rank-metric codes with unique algebraic structures and the exploration of invariants to distinguish these codes from known families and random ones. This section reviews the related works that align with these themes and highlights their connections to our research on geometric invariants for linear rank-metric codes.

The foundational work on Gabidulin codes has inspired numerous studies aimed at generalizing and extending their algebraic structures. Ndiaye et al. (2023) delve into the generalization of Subspace Subcodes within the rank-metric context, providing algorithms for constructing generator and parity-check matrices. Their focus on the algebraic structure and bounds of Gabidulin codes complements our investigation into distinguishing these codes using geometric invariants (Ndiaye et al., 2023). Similarly, Neri (2018) introduces $q$-Cauchy matrices to characterize generator matrices for generalized Gabidulin codes, offering structural insights that align with our exploration of geometric invariants (Neri, 2018). These works collectively underscore the importance of developing new algebraic frameworks to enhance the understanding and differentiation of rank-metric codes.

The exploration of algebraic invariants as a means to classify and distinguish rank-metric codes is a recurring theme in the literature. Ravagnani (2014) introduces ""Delsarte generalized weights"" for Delsarte rank-metric codes, refining the generalized rank weights for Gabidulin codes. This framework provides a basis for understanding algebraic invariants, which parallels our introduction of a novel geometric invariant inspired by the Schur product (Ravagnani, 2014). Additionally, Randrianarisoa (2019) offers a geometric approach to rank-metric codes, introducing a simpler definition for generalized rank weight. This complements our work on geometric invariants and supports the differentiation of specific code families, such as Gabidulin codes (Randrianarisoa, 2019).

The concept of sum-rank metric codes, which generalizes both rank-metric and Hamming metric codes, has been explored in several studies. Neri (2021) provides an algebraic framework for sum-rank metric codes, introducing twisted linearized Reed-Solomon codes that extend Sheekey's twisted Gabidulin codes. This aligns with our focus on distinguishing rank-metric codes through novel invariants (Neri, 2021). Similarly, Gorla et al. (2023) examine invariants in the context of sum-rank metric codes, offering insights that enhance the differentiation of Gabidulin codes from random ones (Gorla et al., 2023). These studies highlight the potential for further exploration of geometric and algebraic properties in the context of rank-metric and sum-rank metric codes.

The use of geometric and algebraic invariants to distinguish rank-metric codes is further explored in works by Neri et al. (2019) and Horlemann-Trautmann and Marshall (2015). Neri et al. (2019) investigate dimension sequences of linear spaces generated by rank-metric codes under field automorphisms as invariants for code equivalence, aligning with our research on geometric invariants inspired by the Schur product (Neri et al., 2019). Horlemann-Trautmann and Marshall (2015) provide a new criterion for identifying maximum rank distance (MRD) codes and distinguishing generalized Gabidulin codes, complementing our approach of using Schur powers to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones (Horlemann-Trautmann & Marshall, 2015).

In summary, the related works collectively emphasize the significance of developing new algebraic structures and invariants to enhance the understanding and differentiation of rank-metric codes. Our research contributes to this body of work by introducing a novel geometric invariant inspired by the Schur product, offering a new perspective on distinguishing Gabidulin codes from random ones. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we provide a geometric approach that complements existing algebraic frameworks and enriches the theoretical understanding of rank-metric codes.","Ousmane Ndiaye, Peter Arnaud Kidoudou, Hervé Tale Kalachi (2023).
