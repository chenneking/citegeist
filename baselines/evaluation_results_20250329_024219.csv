        Source Paper Abstract:
        A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced.
This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy
and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the
ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the
perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum
profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase
space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the
microscopic chaos.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We present extensive numerical investigations on the ergodic properties of
two identical Pomeau-Manneville maps interacting on the unit square through a
diffusive linear coupling. The system exhibits anomalous statistics, as
expected, but with strong deviations from the single intermittent map: Such
differences are characterized by numerical experiments with densities which
{\it do not} have singularities in the marginal fixed point, escape and
Poincar\'e recurrence time statistics that share a power-law decay exponent
modified by a clear {\it dimensional} scaling, while the rate of phase-space
filling and the convergence of ensembles of Lyapunov exponents show a {\it
stretched} instead of pure exponential behaviour. In spite of the lack of
rigorous results about this system, the dependence on both the intermittency
and the coupling parameters appears to be smooth, paving the way for further
analytical development. We remark that dynamical exponents appear to be
independent of the (nonzero) coupling strength.

    In recent years, the study of coupled dynamical systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of understanding ergodic properties and chaotic behavior. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Sala et al. (2014), which investigates the ergodic properties of two coupled Pomeau-Manneville maps. Their research highlights the anomalous statistical behavior of these systems, characterized by deviations from single intermittent maps. Through extensive numerical experiments, they demonstrate how the coupling influences the phase-space dynamics, leading to stretched exponential behavior in Lyapunov exponents and modified power-law decay in recurrence time statistics. This work underscores the importance of coupling parameters in shaping the dynamical properties of systems, a theme that resonates with our study of coupled cat maps, where the specific choice of coupling facilitates the exact determination of Lyapunov exponents (Sala et al., 2014).

Another significant contribution to the understanding of chaotic systems is the work by Chiem (2025), which focuses on the uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponent for $C^1$ monotone potentials generated by the cat map. Chiem's research demonstrates that, under sufficiently large coupling, the Lyapunov exponent remains uniformly positive across all energies. This finding is crucial for understanding the stability and chaotic nature of systems governed by cat maps, providing a theoretical foundation for analyzing the ergodic properties of such systems. Our research builds upon this by exploring how local perturbations in a lattice of coupled cat maps lead to diffusive transport in phase space, further elucidating the relationship between microscopic chaos and macroscopic diffusion (Chiem, 2025).

The construction of Arnol'd cat map lattices, as explored by Axenides et al. (2022), offers another perspective on the chaotic dynamics of coupled systems. Their work delves into the spatio-temporal chaotic properties of cat map lattices, emphasizing the role of symplectic group elements in the evolution of linearly coupled maps. By drawing parallels between cat maps and Fibonacci sequences, they provide insights into the ergodicity and mixing properties of these systems. The study of inverted harmonic oscillators and the interplay between potential runaway behavior and toroidal compactification further enriches the understanding of chaotic dynamics. Our research complements these findings by providing a model where the diffusion process can be directly inferred from the underlying chaotic dynamics, offering a tangible example of how chaos influences transport properties in phase space (Axenides et al., 2022).

In summary, the existing body of work on coupled dynamical systems, particularly those involving cat maps, provides a rich foundation for understanding the complex interplay between chaos, coupling, and ergodic properties. Our research contributes to this field by introducing a model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the spread of local perturbations and the resulting diffusive transport, we offer a novel perspective on how microscopic chaos can lead to macroscopic diffusion, thereby advancing the theoretical understanding of chaotic systems and their transport properties.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We construct Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories in phase space and
configuration space. In phase space we impose that the evolution operator of
the linearly coupled maps be an element of the symplectic group, in direct
generalization of the case of one map. To this end we exploit the
correspondence between the cat map and the Fibonacci sequence. The chaotic
properties of these systems can be, also, understood from the equations of
motion in configuration space, where they describe inverted harmonic
oscillators, with the runaway behavior of the potential competing with the
toroidal compactification of the phase space. We highlight the spatio-temporal
chaotic properties of these systems using standard benchmarks for probing
deterministic chaos of dynamical systems, namely the complete dense set of
unstable periodic orbits, which, for long periods, lead to ergodicity and
mixing. The spectrum of the periods exhibits a strong dependence on the
strength and the range of the interaction.
