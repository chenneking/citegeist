        Source Paper Abstract:
        Large Language Models have shown impressive per-
formance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured
and unstructured textual data. More recently, adaptions of these
models have drawn attention to their abilities to work with code
across different programming languages. On this notion, different
benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest
that certain models have programming abilities comparable
to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate
that the performance on this benchmark does not translate
to the innate ability of humans to appreciate the structural
control flow of code.
For this purpose, we extract code solutions from the Hu-
manEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform very
strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large language models have demonstrated the ability to generate both natural
language and programming language text. Such models open up the possibility of
multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize
knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation
models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about
their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for
translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We
create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using
MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18
additional programming languages.
  We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18
languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using
these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of
three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We
find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several
other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E
allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on
model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation
benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making
it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.

    The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of code generation, with numerous studies exploring their capabilities across various programming languages and benchmarks. A prominent theme in recent research is the extension of code generation benchmarks to support multilingual capabilities, as demonstrated by Cassano et al. (2022) in their work on MultiPL-E. This study introduces a scalable and extensible approach to benchmarking neural code generation by translating existing Python benchmarks into 18 additional programming languages. The authors evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models like Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder across these languages, revealing that Codex can match or exceed its Python performance in several other languages. This work highlights the importance of language diversity in evaluating LLMs and provides a framework for assessing their generalization capabilities across different programming paradigms (Cassano et al., 2022).

Similarly, Raihan et al. (2024) address the limitations of existing code generation benchmarks, particularly in terms of task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope, by introducing mHumanEval. This benchmark extends the HumanEval Benchmark to support prompts in over 200 natural languages, utilizing machine translation methods and expert human translations for 15 diverse languages. The study emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluations that consider low-resource language prompts, offering insights into the multilingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art models. By expanding the linguistic scope, mHumanEval provides a more nuanced understanding of LLM performance across different languages, which is crucial for developing robust code generation models (Raihan et al., 2024).

Another significant contribution to the field is the work by Xue et al. (2024), who propose the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE) method. This ensemble-based approach leverages the multi-language capabilities of LLMs by treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert"" and integrating their outputs to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. The MPLE strategy enhances code generation performance by utilizing the complementary strengths of different programming languages, achieving new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like HumanEval and HumanEval-plus. This study underscores the potential of multi-language ensembles in improving the accuracy and robustness of code generation models (Xue et al., 2024).

In the context of these advancements, our research focuses on a critical aspect of code generation that has been relatively underexplored: the ability of LLMs to appreciate and trace the structural control flow of code. While existing benchmarks like HumanEval have demonstrated the impressive programming abilities of LLMs, our study reveals their limitations in tracing execution paths, particularly for complex structures such as recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. By introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, we aim to bridge the gap in code reasoning abilities, providing a dataset that challenges models to navigate advanced structural components. Our work complements the existing literature by highlighting the need for improved code reasoning capabilities in LLMs, paving the way for future research to enhance their understanding of code execution flow.

        Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced code generation from natural language prompts. The HumanEval
Benchmark, developed by OpenAI, remains the most widely used code generation
benchmark. However, this and other Code LLM benchmarks face critical
limitations, particularly in task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic
scope. Current evaluations primarily focus on English-to-Python conversion
tasks with limited test cases, potentially overestimating model performance.
While recent works have addressed test coverage and programming language (PL)
diversity, code generation from low-resource language prompts remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce mHumanEval, an extended benchmark
supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. We employ established machine
translation methods to compile the benchmark, coupled with a quality assurance
process. Furthermore, we provide expert human translations for 15 diverse
natural languages (NLs). We conclude by analyzing the multilingual code
generation capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Code LLMs, offering insights
into the current landscape of cross-lingual code generation.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved code generation,
particularly in one-pass code generation. However, most existing approaches
focus solely on generating code in a single programming language, overlooking
the potential of leveraging the multi-language capabilities of LLMs. LLMs have
varying patterns of errors across different languages, suggesting that a more
robust approach could be developed by leveraging these multi-language outputs.
In this study, we propose Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), a novel
ensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming
languages to enhance overall performance. By treating each language-specific
code generation process as an individual ""weak expert"" and effectively
integrating their outputs, our method mitigates language-specific errors and
biases. This multi-language ensemble strategy leverages the complementary
strengths of different programming languages, enabling the model to produce
more accurate and robust code. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with
commonly used techniques such as the reflection algorithm and Monte Carlo tree
search to improve code generation quality further. Experimental results show
that our framework consistently enhances baseline performance by up to 17.92%
on existing benchmarks (HumanEval and HumanEval-plus), with a standout result
of 96.25% accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art
results across various LLM models. The code will be released at

benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest
that certain models have programming abilities comparable
to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate
that the performance on this benchmark does not translate
to the innate ability of humans to appreciate the structural
control flow of code.
For this purpose, we extract code solutions from the Hu-
manEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform very
strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.

    The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of code generation, with numerous studies exploring their capabilities across various programming languages and benchmarks. A prominent theme in recent research is the extension of code generation benchmarks to support multilingual capabilities, as demonstrated by Cassano et al. (2022) in their work on MultiPL-E. This study introduces a scalable and extensible approach to benchmarking neural code generation by translating existing Python benchmarks into 18 additional programming languages. The authors evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models like Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder across these languages, revealing that Codex can match or exceed its Python performance in several other languages. This work highlights the importance of language diversity in evaluating LLMs and provides a framework for assessing their generalization capabilities across different programming paradigms (Cassano et al., 2022).

Similarly, Raihan et al. (2024) address the limitations of existing code generation benchmarks, particularly in terms of task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope, by introducing mHumanEval. This benchmark extends the HumanEval Benchmark to support prompts in over 200 natural languages, utilizing machine translation methods and expert human translations for 15 diverse languages. The study emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluations that consider low-resource language prompts, offering insights into the multilingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art models. By expanding the linguistic scope, mHumanEval provides a more nuanced understanding of LLM performance across different languages, which is crucial for developing robust code generation models (Raihan et al., 2024).

Another significant contribution to the field is the work by Xue et al. (2024), who propose the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE) method. This ensemble-based approach leverages the multi-language capabilities of LLMs by treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert"" and integrating their outputs to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. The MPLE strategy enhances code generation performance by utilizing the complementary strengths of different programming languages, achieving new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like HumanEval and HumanEval-plus. This study underscores the potential of multi-language ensembles in improving the accuracy and robustness of code generation models (Xue et al., 2024).

In the context of these advancements, our research focuses on a critical aspect of code generation that has been relatively underexplored: the ability of LLMs to appreciate and trace the structural control flow of code. While existing benchmarks like HumanEval have demonstrated the impressive programming abilities of LLMs, our study reveals their limitations in tracing execution paths, particularly for complex structures such as recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. By introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, we aim to bridge the gap in code reasoning abilities, providing a dataset that challenges models to navigate advanced structural components. Our work complements the existing literature by highlighting the need for improved code reasoning capabilities in LLMs, paving the way for future research to enhance their understanding of code execution flow.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        In a world of increasing closed-source commercial machine learning models,
model evaluations from developers must be taken at face value. These benchmark
results-whether over task accuracy, bias evaluations, or safety checks-are
traditionally impossible to verify by a model end-user without the costly or
impossible process of re-performing the benchmark on black-box model outputs.
This work presents a method of verifiable model evaluation using model
inference through zkSNARKs. The resulting zero-knowledge computational proofs
of model outputs over datasets can be packaged into verifiable evaluation
attestations showing that models with fixed private weights achieve stated
performance or fairness metrics over public inputs. We present a flexible
proving system that enables verifiable attestations to be performed on any
standard neural network model with varying compute requirements. For the first
time, we demonstrate this across a sample of real-world models and highlight
key challenges and design solutions. This presents a new transparency paradigm
in the verifiable evaluation of private models.

    The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) models in various applications has heightened concerns about privacy and security, particularly during the inference phase. A significant body of research has focused on ensuring the privacy of input data, but the privacy of model parameters during inference has received comparatively less attention. Recent advancements in cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, have opened new avenues for addressing these concerns. In this context, the work by South et al. (2024) introduces a method for verifiable evaluations of ML models using zkSNARKs, which allows for the creation of zero-knowledge computational proofs of model outputs. This approach enables the verification of model performance and fairness metrics without revealing the model's private weights, thus providing a new transparency paradigm for private models (South et al., 2024).

In parallel, the study of inference attacks on ML models has been a critical area of research, as these attacks can compromise the privacy of model parameters and training data. Yang (2022) provides a comprehensive risk assessment of various inference attacks, including membership inference, attribute inference, and model stealing attacks. This work highlights the potential threats posed by these attacks and establishes a taxonomy of threat models, offering insights into the factors affecting their performance and their applicability in different scenarios (Yang, 2022). The findings underscore the need for robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to protect model parameters during inference.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by addressing the gap in privacy protection for model parameters during distributed ML inference. While South et al. (2024) focus on verifiable model evaluations, our approach extends the use of zkSNARKs to enable partial privacy in distributed inference settings. By allowing model providers to selectively reveal model sections, our solution ensures verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a customizable set of trusted and untrusted nodes. This selective revelation not only enhances privacy but also fosters trust among all participants in the inference process.

In conclusion, our work contributes to the ongoing discourse on privacy in ML by proposing a novel solution that balances the need for privacy with the requirements of verifiable inference. By leveraging zkSNARKs, we provide a framework that addresses the challenges identified by both South et al. (2024) and Yang (2022), offering a scalable and efficient approach to privacy-preserving inference. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of our solution for models of varying sizes, and we identify promising applications in ML edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned models. Future optimizations will focus on extending support to larger models, further enhancing the scalability and applicability of our approach.

        As machine learning expanding application, there are more and more
unignorable privacy and safety issues. Especially inference attacks against
Machine Learning models allow adversaries to infer sensitive information about
the target model, such as training data, model parameters, etc. Inference
attacks can lead to serious consequences, including violating individuals
privacy, compromising the intellectual property of the owner of the machine
learning model. As far as concerned, researchers have studied and analyzed in
depth several types of inference attacks, albeit in isolation, but there is
still a lack of a holistic rick assessment of inference attacks against machine
learning models, such as their application in different scenarios, the common
factors affecting the performance of these attacks and the relationship among
the attacks. As a result, this paper performs a holistic risk assessment of
different inference attacks against Machine Learning models. This paper focuses
on three kinds of representative attacks: membership inference attack,
attribute inference attack and model stealing attack. And a threat model
taxonomy is established. A total of 12 target models using three model
architectures, including AlexNet, ResNet18 and Simple CNN, are trained on four
datasets, namely CelebA, UTKFace, STL10 and FMNIST.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        The Transformer architecture is widely regarded as the most powerful tool for natural language processing, but due to the high number of complex operations, it inherently faces the issue of extensive energy consumption. To address this issue, we consider spiking neural networks (SNN), an energy-efficient alternative to common artificial neural networks (ANN) due to their naturally event-driven way of processing information. However, this inherently makes them difficult to train, which is why many SNN-related models circumvent this issue through the conversion of pre-trained ANN networks. More recently, attempts have been made to create directly trained SNN-based adaptions of the Transformer model structure. While the results showed great promise, their sole application field was computer vision and based on incorporating encoder blocks. In this paper, we propose SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, for application on the field of natural language processing. We further analyze the impact of exchanging different blocks of the ANN model with their spike-based alternatives to identify pain points and significant sources of performance loss. Similarly, we extend our investigation to the role of residual connections and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques. Besides the work on the model architecture, we formulate and compare different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the spiking decoder block reduces the theoretical energy consumption by 87 to 93 percent compared to the power required for a regular encoder block.

it a valuable issue to explore more general spike-driven models. However, the
binary spikes in existing SNNs fail to encode adequate semantic information,
placing technological challenges for generalization. This work proposes the
first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both
discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes with {0,1}
levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional,
elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the
addition nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by
direction and amplitude information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control
spike firing rate is well designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism
in language modeling, named SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general
language tasks with fully spike-driven models, which achieve much higher
accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also greatly bridges the performance
gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling. Our code is available at

    Source Abstract:
    The Transformer architecture is widely regarded as the most powerful tool for natural language processing, but due to the high number of complex operations, it inherently faces the issue of extensive energy consumption. To address this issue, we consider spiking neural networks (SNN), an energy-efficient alternative to common artificial neural networks (ANN) due to their naturally event-driven way of processing information. However, this inherently makes them difficult to train, which is why many SNN-related models circumvent this issue through the conversion of pre-trained ANN networks. More recently, attempts have been made to create directly trained SNN-based adaptions of the Transformer model structure. While the results showed great promise, their sole application field was computer vision and based on incorporating encoder blocks. In this paper, we propose SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, for application on the field of natural language processing. We further analyze the impact of exchanging different blocks of the ANN model with their spike-based alternatives to identify pain points and significant sources of performance loss. Similarly, we extend our investigation to the role of residual connections and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques. Besides the work on the model architecture, we formulate and compare different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the spiking decoder block reduces the theoretical energy consumption by 87 to 93 percent compared to the power required for a regular encoder block.

Xingrun Xing et al.

The authors highlight the challenges of encoding text into spike trains, a critical step for integrating NLP tasks into the neuromorphic computing paradigm. By comparing various text encoding methods, they propose a novel technique that surpasses the traditional Poisson rate-coding method, achieving a 13% improvement in performance on benchmark NLP tasks. Their findings underscore the substantial energy savings of SNNs over traditional deep neural networks, with a reported 32x increase in energy efficiency during inference and 60x during training. This work not only reinforces the viability of SNNs in NLP but also provides practical insights into optimizing text encoding for spike-based models (Knipper et al., 2024).

Both of these studies underscore the growing interest in leveraging the energy-efficient properties of SNNs for NLP applications, a field traditionally dominated by power-intensive ANN architectures.

        As spiking neural networks receive more attention, we look toward
applications of this computing paradigm in fields other than computer vision
and signal processing. One major field, underexplored in the neuromorphic
setting, is Natural Language Processing (NLP), where most state-of-the-art
solutions still heavily rely on resource-consuming and power-hungry traditional
deep learning architectures. Therefore, it is compelling to design NLP models
for neuromorphic architectures due to their low energy requirements, with the
additional benefit of a more human-brain-like operating model for processing
information. However, one of the biggest issues with bringing NLP to the
neuromorphic setting is in properly encoding text into a spike train so that it
can be seamlessly handled by both current and future SNN architectures. In this
paper, we compare various methods of encoding text as spikes and assess each
method's performance in an associated SNN on a downstream NLP task, namely,
sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we go on to propose a new method of encoding
text as spikes that outperforms a widely-used rate-coding technique, Poisson
rate-coding, by around 13\% on our benchmark NLP tasks. Subsequently, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of SNNs implemented in hardware for the
sentiment analysis task compared to traditional deep neural networks, observing
an energy efficiency increase of more than 32x during inference and 60x during
training while incurring the expected energy-performance tradeoff.

with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches
harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first

        Animal ethology is an crucial aspect of animal research, and animal behavior
labeling is the foundation for studying animal behavior. This process typically
involves labeling video clips with behavioral semantic tags, a task that is
complex, subjective, and multimodal. With the rapid development of multimodal
large language models(LLMs), new application have emerged for animal behavior
understanding tasks in livestock scenarios. This study evaluates the visual
perception capabilities of multimodal LLMs in animal activity recognition. To
achieve this, we created piglet test data comprising close-up video clips of
individual piglets and annotated full-shot video clips. These data were used to
assess the performance of four multimodal LLMs-Video-LLaMA, MiniGPT4-Video,
Video-Chat2, and GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o)-in piglet activity understanding. Through
comprehensive evaluation across five dimensions, including counting, actor
referring, semantic correspondence, time perception, and robustness, we found
that while current multimodal LLMs require improvement in semantic
correspondence and time perception, they have initially demonstrated visual
perception capabilities for animal activity recognition. Notably, GPT-4o showed
outstanding performance, with Video-Chat2 and GPT-4o exhibiting significantly
better semantic correspondence and time perception in close-up video clips
compared to full-shot clips. The initial evaluation experiments in this study
validate the potential of multimodal large language models in livestock scene
video understanding and provide new directions and references for future
research on animal behavior video understanding. Furthermore, by deeply
exploring the influence of visual prompts on multimodal large language models,
we expect to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of animal behavior recognition
in livestock scenarios through human visual processing methods.

    The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements, particularly in the realm of visual understanding. Recent studies have explored the application of MLLMs in various domains, including animal behavior recognition and comprehensive video understanding. Wu et al. (2024) investigate the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs in the context of animal ethology, specifically focusing on piglet activity understanding. Their study highlights the potential of MLLMs in recognizing animal activities through video data, although they note limitations in semantic correspondence and time perception. This work underscores the importance of enhancing temporal understanding in MLLMs, a challenge that is also central to our research, which aims to improve video understanding by addressing similar limitations in zero-shot inference and fine-tuning approaches.

In a broader context, Han et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements in multimodal pretrained models, emphasizing the integration of diverse data forms such as text, images, audio, and video. Their tutorial covers the evolution of multimodal research and the technical challenges faced by these models, including instruction tuning strategies to optimize performance for specific tasks. This aligns with our research focus on improving the learning efficiency of MLLMs through innovative data augmentation methods, such as our proposed T2Vid, which enriches instruction diversity and enhances training outcomes.

Zou et al. (2024) delve into the challenges of long video understanding, highlighting the unique requirements of processing sequential frames and capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Their survey traces the progression of MLLMs from image understanding to long video comprehension, identifying the need for models that can handle more complex spatiotemporal details and dynamic events. Our work contributes to this ongoing discourse by demonstrating that our training scheme can boost long video understanding performance without the need for extensive long video samples, thus addressing some of the challenges identified by Zou et al.

In summary, the existing body of work on MLLMs provides a rich foundation for exploring video understanding, with each study contributing unique insights into the capabilities and limitations of these models. Our research builds on these findings by proposing a novel data augmentation method that enhances instruction diversity, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of MLLMs in video understanding tasks. By achieving comparable performance with a reduced sample size, our approach not only addresses current limitations but also offers a scalable solution for future applications in video understanding.

successful experiences, researchers have recently explored
extending the success to the video understanding realms.
Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream
approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning
with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches
harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first
make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and
identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack
of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further
investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples,
which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity.
Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid
to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction
diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves
performance comparable to or even superior to using full
video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size.

        The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has
recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging
their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual
reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language
Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for
understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the
substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding
compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images,
short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event
temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with
between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to
trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to
long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual
understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding,
including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and
long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements
in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for
understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing
MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss
potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.

        Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

        Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information
across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are
now involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice,
but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and
what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to
bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future
of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which
models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary
perspectives. The AI Thinking model addresses five practice-based competencies
involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use in information processes,
formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting
appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used
in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI
Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader
cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing
discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help
to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI use,
and to reshape the future of AI in practice.

    In recent years, the exploration of human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence has gained significant attention, with various frameworks proposed to enhance AI's cognitive capabilities. One such framework is AI Thinking, introduced by Denis Newman-Griffis (2024), which emphasizes the interdisciplinary application of AI across diverse contexts. AI Thinking models key decisions involved in AI use, such as motivating AI applications, formulating methods, and situating AI within sociotechnical environments. This framework highlights the importance of bridging divides between academic disciplines to reshape AI's future in practice. While AI Thinking focuses on the broader application of AI, it aligns with the goals of Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) by advocating for a more holistic approach to AI reasoning, which includes both forward and backward thinking processes (Newman-Griffis, 2024).

Another relevant approach is the multi-agent framework for lateral thinking introduced by Stefan Dernbach et al. (2024). Their work, Thinking Fast and Laterally, aims to implement System-2 reasoning capabilities in AI systems, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under uncertainty. The Streaming Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT) framework leverages dynamic communication between specialized agents to enhance reasoning through lateral information flow. This approach shares thematic similarities with REVTHINK, as both frameworks seek to enrich AI reasoning by incorporating diverse thinking strategies. While SALT emphasizes lateral thinking in streaming environments, REVTHINK focuses on reverse thinking to improve consistency checks and reasoning performance (Dernbach et al., 2024).

The concept of Thought Cloning, proposed by Shengran Hu and Jeff Clune (2023), further explores the integration of human-like thinking in AI systems. Thought Cloning aims to train AI agents to think like humans by imitating human thoughts during actions, thereby enhancing generalization, exploration, and adaptability. This framework demonstrates the benefits of thinking in language, which aligns with REVTHINK's objective of enabling large language models to perform reverse thinking. Both Thought Cloning and REVTHINK emphasize the importance of reasoning in language to improve AI's ability to handle novel situations and ensure safety and interpretability (Hu & Clune, 2023).

In summary, the exploration of human-like reasoning in AI systems is a rapidly evolving field, with frameworks such as AI Thinking, SALT, and Thought Cloning contributing valuable insights. REVTHINK builds upon these foundations by introducing a novel approach to reverse thinking, enhancing reasoning performance through structured forward-backward reasoning. By augmenting datasets and employing multi-task learning objectives, REVTHINK demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning tasks across various domains. This work not only advances the understanding of reverse thinking in AI but also highlights the potential for improved sample efficiency and generalization to out-of-distribution datasets, paving the way for more robust and versatile AI systems.

        Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

capabilities in AI systems, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under
uncertainty. We present a framework for systematic generation and modeling of
lateral thinking queries and evaluation datasets. We introduce Streaming
Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT), a multi-agent framework designed to process
complex, low-specificity queries in streaming data environments. SALT
implements lateral thinking-inspired System-2 reasoning through a dynamic
communication structure between specialized agents. Our key insight is that
lateral information flow across long-distance agent interactions, combined with
fine-grained belief management, yields richer information contexts and enhanced
reasoning. Preliminary quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate SALT's
potential to outperform single-agent systems in handling complex lateral
reasoning tasks in a streaming environment.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Language is often considered a key aspect of human thinking, providing us
with exceptional abilities to generalize, explore, plan, replan, and adapt to
new situations. However, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are far from
human-level performance in any of these abilities. We hypothesize one reason
for such cognitive deficiencies is that they lack the benefits of thinking in
language and that we can improve AI agents by training them to think like
humans do. We introduce a novel Imitation Learning framework, Thought Cloning,
where the idea is to not just clone the behaviors of human demonstrators, but
also the thoughts humans have as they perform these behaviors. While we expect
Thought Cloning to truly shine at scale on internet-sized datasets of humans
thinking out loud while acting (e.g. online videos with transcripts), here we
conduct experiments in a domain where the thinking and action data are
synthetically generated. Results reveal that Thought Cloning learns much faster
than Behavioral Cloning and its performance advantage grows the further out of
distribution test tasks are, highlighting its ability to better handle novel
situations. Thought Cloning also provides important benefits for AI Safety and
Interpretability, and makes it easier to debug and improve AI. Because we can
observe the agent's thoughts, we can (1) more easily diagnose why things are
going wrong, making it easier to fix the problem, (2) steer the agent by
correcting its thinking, or (3) prevent it from doing unsafe things it plans to
do. Overall, by training agents how to think as well as behave, Thought Cloning
creates safer, more powerful agents.

        This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Consider a market where a seller owns an item for sale and a buyer wants to
purchase it. Each player has private information, known as their type. It can
be costly and difficult for the players to reach an agreement through direct
communication. However, with a mediator as a trusted third party, both players
can communicate privately with the mediator without worrying about leaking too
much or too little information. The mediator can design and commit to a
multi-round communication protocol for both players, in which they update their
beliefs about the other player's type. The mediator cannot force the players to
trade but can influence their behaviors by sending messages to them.
  We study the problem of designing revenue-maximizing mechanisms for the
mediator. We show that the mediator can, without loss of generality, focus on a
set of direct and incentive-compatible mechanisms. We then formulate this
problem as a mathematical program and provide an optimal solution in closed
form under a regularity condition. Our mechanism is simple and has a threshold
structure. Additionally, we extend our results to general cases by utilizing a
variant version of the ironing technique. In the end, we discuss some
interesting properties revealed from the optimal mechanism, such as, in the
optimal mechanism, the mediator may even lose money in some cases.

    In recent years, the study of mediated communication and its implications for strategic interactions has garnered significant attention. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Fan and Shen (2024), who explore revenue maximization mechanisms for an uninformed mediator with communication abilities. Their research focuses on a market setting where a mediator facilitates communication between a seller and a buyer, each possessing private information. The mediator's role is to design a communication protocol that maximizes revenue while ensuring incentive compatibility. This study highlights the potential of mediators to influence outcomes through structured communication, even when direct trading is not enforceable. The insights from Fan and Shen's work are relevant to our research as they underscore the importance of communication mechanisms in enhancing strategic outcomes, albeit in a different context of market transactions [Fan & Shen, 2024].

Another significant line of research is the exploration of mediated cheap talk, as investigated by Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2022). Their study examines a scenario with two informed senders and a receiver, where the senders lack commitment power. The authors characterize the set of implementable action distributions in equilibrium and propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal equilibrium for the senders. This work is particularly relevant to our study as it delves into the dynamics of information transmission and the role of mediators in facilitating communication without commitment power. The parallels between their findings and our exploration of money-burning tactics for commitment power highlight the diverse strategies available to enhance communication efficacy in strategic settings [Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022].

Further extending the discussion on mediation, Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2023) investigate the value of mediation in long cheap talk scenarios. Their research demonstrates that while a mediator may not directly benefit the sender or receiver, it can enhance the payoff of an external decision-maker affected by the receiver's actions. This study provides insights into the broader implications of mediation beyond the immediate parties involved, suggesting that mediation can create value in complex strategic environments. The findings from this research resonate with our work, as they emphasize the multifaceted benefits of mediation, which can be leveraged through innovative tactics such as money-burning to achieve desired outcomes [Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2023].

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by introducing a novel approach to mediated communication through money-burning tactics. Unlike previous works that focus on traditional mediation roles, our model incorporates a mechanism where the sender can enhance commitment power by strategically burning money. This approach not only improves the sender's equilibrium payoff but also offers a geometric interpretation linked to robust Bayesian persuasion. Furthermore, our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities provides a contemporary context for understanding the commitment value in decentralized environments. By integrating these elements, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on mediated communication, offering new perspectives and practical implications for strategic interactions in modern digital ecosystems.

        This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.

receiver in which, in contrast to traditional Bayesian persuasion settings,
senders do not have commitment power. In our setting, a trusted
mediator/platform gathers data from the senders and recommends the receiver
which action to play. We characterize the set of implementable action
distributions that can be obtained in equilibrium, and provide an $O(n \log n)$
algorithm (where $n$ is the number of states) that computes the optimal
equilibrium for the senders. Additionally, we show that the optimal equilibrium
for the receiver can be obtained by a simple revelation mechanism.

        In this paper, we study an extension of the classic long cheap talk
equilibrium introduced by Aumann and Hart~\citeN{aumann-hart-03}, and ask how
much can the players benefit from having a trusted mediator compared with the
standard unmediated model. We focus on a setting where a fully informed sender
without commitment power must disclose its information to influence the
behavior of a self-interested receiver. We show that, in the case of binary
actions, even though a mediator does not help neither the sender nor the
receiver directly, it may still allow improving the payoff of an external
decision-maker whose utility is affected by the realized state and the
receiver's action. Moreover, we show that if there are more than two actions,
there exist games in which both the sender and the receiver simultaneously
benefit from mediation.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Nanson's and Baldwin's voting rules select a winner by successively
eliminating candidates with low Borda scores. We show that these rules have a
number of desirable computational properties. In particular, with unweighted
votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with one manipulator, whilst
with weighted votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with a small
number of candidates and a coalition of manipulators. As only a couple of other
voting rules are known to be NP-hard to manipulate with a single manipulator,
Nanson's and Baldwin's rules appear to be particularly resistant to
manipulation from a theoretical perspective. We also propose a number of
approximation methods for manipulating these two rules. Experiments demonstrate
that both rules are often difficult to manipulate in practice. These results
suggest that elimination style voting rules deserve further study.

    The study of Condorcet extensions and their associated paradoxes has been a significant area of research in social choice theory. A key focus has been on understanding the computational and strategic properties of various voting rules that extend the Condorcet principle. Narodytska, Walsh, and Xia (2011) explore the manipulation of Nanson's and Baldwin's rules, which are elimination-style voting rules that have been shown to possess desirable computational properties. Their work highlights the resistance of these rules to manipulation, particularly in scenarios involving a single manipulator or a coalition of manipulators. This resistance to manipulation is relevant to our investigation of Condorcet extensions, as it underscores the importance of robustness in voting rules, a theme that resonates with our exploration of the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in Condorcet extensions.

Another significant contribution to the understanding of Condorcet-consistent rules is provided by Elkind, Faliszewski, and Slinko (2010), who examine the distance rationalizability of such rules. They focus on the Maximin rule, among others, and demonstrate how it can be rationalized using distances akin to the Hamming distance. Their findings reveal the computational complexity associated with determining winners under these rules, which parallels our investigation into the axiomatic characterizations of Maximin and its refinements. The insights from their work on the computational aspects of Condorcet-consistent rules provide a foundational backdrop for our analysis of the paradoxes affecting these rules.

The complexity of candidate nomination in elections using Condorcet-consistent rules is further explored by Schlotter and Cechlárová (2025). They analyze the Possible President problem across various voting rules, including Maximin, and provide a comprehensive computational complexity analysis. Their work delineates the boundaries of tractability for these problems, offering a nuanced understanding of the challenges involved in candidate nomination. This complements our research by highlighting the intricate dynamics of Condorcet-consistent rules in multi-candidate elections, reinforcing the need for robust solutions to paradoxes like the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes.

Darlington (2017) provides a compelling argument for the necessity of Condorcet consistency in voting systems. By systematically dismissing electoral criteria that conflict with Condorcet consistency, Darlington emphasizes the fundamental role of majority rule in two-candidate elections and its extension to multi-candidate scenarios. This perspective aligns with our focus on Condorcet extensions, as it underscores the importance of maintaining consistency with majority preferences, a principle that is central to our investigation of paradoxes in three-candidate elections.

In summary, our research builds on these foundational works by specifically addressing the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in the context of three-candidate elections. By establishing conditions under which certain refinements of the Maximin rule are immune to these paradoxes, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on the robustness and reliability of Condorcet-consistent voting rules. Our axiomatic characterizations of Maximin and its refinements further enhance the understanding of their suitability for elections, providing a nuanced perspective on the challenges and solutions associated with Condorcet extensions.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The main idea of the {\em distance rationalizability} approach to view the
voters' preferences as an imperfect approximation to some kind of consensus is
deeply rooted in social choice literature. It allows one to define
(""rationalize"") voting rules via a consensus class of elections and a distance:
a candidate is said to be an election winner if she is ranked first in one of
the nearest (with respect to the given distance) consensus elections. It is
known that many classic voting rules can be distance rationalized. In this
paper, we provide new results on distance rationalizability of several
Condorcet-consistent voting rules. In particular, we distance rationalize
Young's rule and Maximin rule using distances similar to the Hamming distance.
We show that the claim that Young's rule can be rationalized by the Condorcet
consensus class and the Hamming distance is incorrect; in fact, these consensus
class and distance yield a new rule which has not been studied before. We prove
that, similarly to Young's rule, this new rule has a computationally hard
winner determination problem.

        Consider elections where the set of candidates is partitioned into parties,
and each party must nominate exactly one candidate. The Possible President
problem asks whether some candidate of a given party can become the winner of
the election for some nominations from other parties. We perform a multivariate
computational complexity analysis of Possible President for a range of
Condorcet-consistent voting rules, namely for Copeland$^\alpha$ for $\alpha \in
[0,1]$ and Maximin. The parameters we study are the number of voters, the
number of parties, and the maximum size of a party. For all voting rules under
consideration, we obtain dichotomies based on the number of voters, classifying
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete and polynomial-time solvable cases. Moreover, for each
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete variant, we determine the parameterized complexity of
every possible parameterization with the studied parameters as either (a)
fixed-parameter tractable, (b) $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard but in $\mathsf{XP}$, or
(c) $\mathsf{paraNP}$-hard, outlining the limits of tractability for these
problems.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        In a single winner election with several candidates and ranked choice or
rating scale ballots, a Condorcet winner is one who wins all their two way
races by majority rule or MR. A voting system has Condorcet consistency or CC
if it names any Condorcet winner the winner. Many voting systems lack CC, but a
three step line of reasoning is used here to show why it is necessary. In step
1 we show that we can dismiss all the electoral criteria which conflict with
CC. In step 2 we point out that CC follows almost automatically if we can agree
that MR is the only acceptable system for elections with two candidates. In
step 3 we make that argument for MR. This argument itself has three parts.
First, in races with two candidates, the only well known alternatives to MR can
sometimes name as winner a candidate who is preferred over their opponent by
only one voter, with all others preferring the opponent. That is unacceptable.
Second, those same systems are also extremely susceptible to strategic
insincere voting. Third, in simulation studies using spatial models with two
candidates, the best known alternative to MR picks the best or most centrist
candidate significantly less often than MR does.

extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.

    The study of Condorcet extensions and their associated paradoxes has been a significant area of research in social choice theory. A key focus has been on understanding the computational and strategic properties of various voting rules that extend the Condorcet principle. Narodytska, Walsh, and Xia (2011) explore the manipulation of Nanson's and Baldwin's rules, which are elimination-style voting rules that have been shown to possess desirable computational properties. Their work highlights the resistance of these rules to manipulation, particularly in scenarios involving a single manipulator or a coalition of manipulators. This resistance to manipulation is relevant to our investigation of Condorcet extensions, as it underscores the importance of robustness in voting rules, a theme that resonates with our exploration of the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in Condorcet extensions.

Another significant contribution to the understanding of Condorcet-consistent rules is provided by Elkind, Faliszewski, and Slinko (2010), who examine the distance rationalizability of such rules. They focus on the Maximin rule, among others, and demonstrate how it can be rationalized using distances akin to the Hamming distance. Their findings reveal the computational complexity associated with determining winners under these rules, which parallels our investigation into the axiomatic characterizations of Maximin and its refinements. The insights from their work on the computational aspects of Condorcet-consistent rules provide a foundational backdrop for our analysis of the paradoxes affecting these rules.

The complexity of candidate nomination in elections using Condorcet-consistent rules is further explored by Schlotter and Cechlárová (2025). They analyze the Possible President problem across various voting rules, including Maximin, and provide a comprehensive computational complexity analysis. Their work delineates the boundaries of tractability for these problems, offering a nuanced understanding of the challenges involved in candidate nomination. This complements our research by highlighting the intricate dynamics of Condorcet-consistent rules in multi-candidate elections, reinforcing the need for robust solutions to paradoxes like the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes.

Darlington (2017) provides a compelling argument for the necessity of Condorcet consistency in voting systems. By systematically dismissing electoral criteria that conflict with Condorcet consistency, Darlington emphasizes the fundamental role of majority rule in two-candidate elections and its extension to multi-candidate scenarios. This perspective aligns with our focus on Condorcet extensions, as it underscores the importance of maintaining consistency with majority preferences, a principle that is central to our investigation of paradoxes in three-candidate elections.

In summary, our research builds on these foundational works by specifically addressing the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in the context of three-candidate elections. By establishing conditions under which certain refinements of the Maximin rule are immune to these paradoxes, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on the robustness and reliability of Condorcet-consistent voting rules. Our axiomatic characterizations of Maximin and its refinements further enhance the understanding of their suitability for elections, providing a nuanced perspective on the challenges and solutions associated with Condorcet extensions.

        A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced.
This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy
and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the
ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the
perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum
profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase
space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the
microscopic chaos.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We construct Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories in phase space and
configuration space. In phase space we impose that the evolution operator of
the linearly coupled maps be an element of the symplectic group, in direct
generalization of the case of one map. To this end we exploit the
correspondence between the cat map and the Fibonacci sequence. The chaotic
properties of these systems can be, also, understood from the equations of
motion in configuration space, where they describe inverted harmonic
oscillators, with the runaway behavior of the potential competing with the
toroidal compactification of the phase space. We highlight the spatio-temporal
chaotic properties of these systems using standard benchmarks for probing
deterministic chaos of dynamical systems, namely the complete dense set of
unstable periodic orbits, which, for long periods, lead to ergodicity and
mixing. The spectrum of the periods exhibits a strong dependence on the
strength and the range of the interaction.

    In recent years, the study of chaotic dynamics in coupled map lattices has garnered significant attention, particularly in understanding the interplay between local chaos and global transport properties. A foundational work in this area is the study of Arnol'd cat map lattices by Axenides, Floratos, and Nicolis (2022), which constructs lattice field theories in both phase and configuration spaces. Their work highlights the chaotic properties of these systems through the lens of symplectic group evolution operators and the correspondence with the Fibonacci sequence. The authors demonstrate how the chaotic dynamics, characterized by a dense set of unstable periodic orbits, lead to ergodicity and mixing, with the spectrum of periods being sensitive to the interaction's strength and range. This study provides a crucial backdrop for understanding the chaotic behavior in lattice systems, which is a central theme in our research on coupled cat maps (Axenides et al., 2022).

Another significant contribution to the field is the exploration of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos by Raj and Paul (2024). They investigate a one-dimensional lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps, focusing on how varying diffusion strength affects chaotic dynamics. Their findings reveal that increasing diffusion strength initially reduces the leading Lyapunov exponent, creating a window of periodic dynamics before returning to chaos. This work is particularly relevant to our study as it provides insights into how diffusion can modulate chaotic behavior and transport properties, a phenomenon we also observe in our model of coupled cat maps. The analytical description of the Lyapunov spectrum and the spatial features of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) in their study offer a valuable framework for understanding the diffusion processes in chaotic systems (Raj & Paul, 2024).

The investigation of anomalous diffusion in single and coupled standard maps by Moges, Manos, and Skokos (2021) further enriches the discourse on chaotic transport. Their research delves into the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of standard maps, identifying conditions that lead to anomalous diffusion due to accelerator modes. They demonstrate that while individual maps may exhibit anomalous transport, the global diffusion behavior in coupled systems depends on the coupling configuration. This study underscores the complexity of diffusion processes in chaotic systems and aligns with our findings on how local perturbations in coupled cat maps lead to diffusive transport in phase space. The insights from this work help contextualize the diffusion mechanisms observed in our model, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in shaping transport properties (Moges et al., 2021).

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by introducing a novel model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the ergodic properties of the dynamics under local perturbations, we provide a unique example where diffusion can be directly inferred from microscopic chaos. This work not only contributes to the understanding of chaotic transport in coupled map lattices but also bridges the gap between local chaotic dynamics and global diffusion processes, offering new perspectives on the interplay between chaos and transport in complex systems.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We explore the chaotic dynamics of a large one-dimensional lattice of coupled
maps with diffusive coupling of varying strength using the covariant Lyapunov
vectors (CLVs). Using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps we
quantify the growth of spatial structures in the chaotic dynamics as the
strength of diffusion is increased. When the diffusion strength is increased
from zero, we find that the leading Lyapunov exponent decreases rapidly from a
positive value to zero to yield a small window of periodic dynamics which is
then followed by chaotic dynamics. For values of the diffusion strength beyond
the window of periodic dynamics, the leading Lyapunov exponent does not vary
significantly with the strength of diffusion with the exception of a small
variation for the largest diffusion strengths we explore. The Lyapunov spectrum
and fractal dimension are described analytically as a function of the diffusion
strength using the eigenvalues of the coupling operator. The spatial features
of the CLVs are quantified and compared with the eigenvectors of the coupling
operator. The chaotic dynamics are composed entirely of physical modes for all
of the conditions we explore. The leading CLV is highly localized and the
localization decreases with increasing strength of the spatial coupling. The
violation of the dominance of Oseledets splitting indicates that the
entanglement of pairs of CLVs becomes more significant between neighboring CLVs
as the strength of the diffusion is increased.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We investigate the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of
single and coupled standard maps. We consider model parameters that are known
to induce anomalous diffusion in the maps' phase spaces, as opposed to normal
diffusion which is associated with Gaussian distribution properties of the
kinematic variables. This type of transport originates in the presence of the
so-called accelerator modes, i.e.~non-chaotic initial conditions which exhibit
ballistic transport, which also affect the dynamics in their vicinity. We first
systematically study the dynamics of single standard maps, investigating the
impact of different ensembles of initial conditions on their behavior and
asymptotic diffusion rates, as well as on the respective time-scales needed to
acquire these rates. We consider sets of initial conditions in chaotic regions
enclosing accelerator modes, which are not bounded by invariant tori. These
types of chaotic initial conditions typically lead to normal diffusion
transport. We then setup different arrangements of coupled standard maps and
investigate their global diffusion properties and chaotic dynamics. Although
individual maps bear accelerator modes causing anomalous transport, the global
diffusion behavior of the coupled system turns out to depend on the specific
configuration of the imposed coupling. Estimating the average diffusion
properties for ensembles of initial conditions, as well as measuring the
strength of chaos through computations of appropriate indicators, we find
conditions and systems' arrangements which systematically favor the suppression
of anomalous transport and long-term convergence to normal diffusion rates.

and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the
ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the
perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum
profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase
space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the
microscopic chaos.

    In recent years, the study of chaotic dynamics in coupled map lattices has garnered significant attention, particularly in understanding the interplay between local chaos and global transport properties. A foundational work in this area is the study of Arnol'd cat map lattices by Axenides, Floratos, and Nicolis (2022), which constructs lattice field theories in both phase and configuration spaces. Their work highlights the chaotic properties of these systems through the lens of symplectic group evolution operators and the correspondence with the Fibonacci sequence. The authors demonstrate how the chaotic dynamics, characterized by a dense set of unstable periodic orbits, lead to ergodicity and mixing, with the spectrum of periods being sensitive to the interaction's strength and range. This study provides a crucial backdrop for understanding the chaotic behavior in lattice systems, which is a central theme in our research on coupled cat maps (Axenides et al., 2022).

Another significant contribution to the field is the exploration of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos by Raj and Paul (2024). They investigate a one-dimensional lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps, focusing on how varying diffusion strength affects chaotic dynamics. Their findings reveal that increasing diffusion strength initially reduces the leading Lyapunov exponent, creating a window of periodic dynamics before returning to chaos. This work is particularly relevant to our study as it provides insights into how diffusion can modulate chaotic behavior and transport properties, a phenomenon we also observe in our model of coupled cat maps. The analytical description of the Lyapunov spectrum and the spatial features of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) in their study offer a valuable framework for understanding the diffusion processes in chaotic systems (Raj & Paul, 2024).

The investigation of anomalous diffusion in single and coupled standard maps by Moges, Manos, and Skokos (2021) further enriches the discourse on chaotic transport. Their research delves into the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of standard maps, identifying conditions that lead to anomalous diffusion due to accelerator modes. They demonstrate that while individual maps may exhibit anomalous transport, the global diffusion behavior in coupled systems depends on the coupling configuration. This study underscores the complexity of diffusion processes in chaotic systems and aligns with our findings on how local perturbations in coupled cat maps lead to diffusive transport in phase space. The insights from this work help contextualize the diffusion mechanisms observed in our model, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in shaping transport properties (Moges et al., 2021).

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by introducing a novel model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the ergodic properties of the dynamics under local perturbations, we provide a unique example where diffusion can be directly inferred from microscopic chaos. This work not only contributes to the understanding of chaotic transport in coupled map lattices but also bridges the gap between local chaotic dynamics and global diffusion processes, offering new perspectives on the interplay between chaos and transport in complex systems.

        The accuracy of simulation-based forecasting in chaotic systems is heavily
dependent on high-quality estimates of the system state at the time the
forecast is initialized. Data assimilation methods are used to infer these
initial conditions by systematically combining noisy, incomplete observations
and numerical models of system dynamics to produce effective estimation
schemes. We introduce amortized assimilation, a framework for learning to
assimilate in dynamical systems from sequences of noisy observations with no
need for ground truth data. We motivate the framework by extending powerful
results from self-supervised denoising to the dynamical systems setting through
the use of differentiable simulation. Experimental results across several
benchmark systems highlight the improved effectiveness of our approach over
widely-used data assimilation methods.

        Data assimilation techniques are often confronted with challenges handling
complex high dimensional physical systems, because high precision simulation in
complex high dimensional physical systems is computationally expensive and the
exact observation functions that can be applied in these systems are difficult
to obtain. It prompts growing interest in integrating deep learning models
within data assimilation workflows, but current software packages for data
assimilation cannot handle deep learning models inside. This study presents a
novel Python package seamlessly combining data assimilation with deep neural
networks to serve as models for state transition and observation functions. The
package, named TorchDA, implements Kalman Filter, Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF), 3D Variational (3DVar), and 4D Variational (4DVar) algorithms, allowing
flexible algorithm selection based on application requirements. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on the Lorenz 63 and a two-dimensional shallow water
system demonstrate significantly enhanced performance over standalone model
predictions without assimilation. The shallow water analysis validates data
assimilation capabilities mapping between different physical quantity spaces in
either full space or reduced order space. Overall, this innovative software
package enables flexible integration of deep learning representations within
data assimilation, conferring a versatile tool to tackle complex high
dimensional dynamical systems across scientific domains.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Data assimilation techniques are crucial for correcting the trajectory when
modeling complex physical systems. A recently developed data assimilation
method, Latent Ensemble Score Filter (Latent-EnSF), has shown great promise in
addressing the key limitation of EnSF for highly sparse observations in
high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. It performs data
assimilation in a latent space for encoded states and observations in every
assimilation step, and requires costly full dynamics to be evolved in the
original space. In this paper, we introduce Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF), a
novel methodology that completely avoids the full dynamics evolution and
significantly accelerates the data assimilation process, which is especially
valuable for complex dynamical problems that require fast data assimilation in
real time. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel variant of Latent Dynamics
Networks (LDNets) to effectively capture and preserve the system's dynamics
within a very low-dimensional latent space. Additionally, we propose a new
method for encoding sparse observations into the latent space using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage not only the current step's
observations, as in Latent-EnSF, but also all previous steps, thereby improving
the accuracy and robustness of the observation encoding. We demonstrate the
robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for two challenging
dynamical systems with highly sparse (in both space and time) and noisy
observations.

    In recent years, the field of data assimilation has seen significant advancements, particularly in the context of chaotic and complex dynamical systems. A common theme among recent studies is the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data assimilation processes. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising in dynamical systems to improve the estimation of initial conditions without relying on ground truth data. Their approach highlights the potential of differentiable simulation in enhancing data assimilation methods, which aligns with the growing trend of incorporating machine learning into traditional frameworks [1].

Similarly, Cheng et al. (2024) developed TorchDA, a Python package that integrates deep learning models within data assimilation workflows. This package supports various algorithms such as the Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, allowing for flexible application across different systems. The integration of deep neural networks as state transition and observation functions demonstrates the potential of deep learning to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional and complex physical systems [2]. This approach is particularly relevant to our work, as it underscores the importance of leveraging machine learning to improve data assimilation without relying on precise noise statistics.

Another innovative approach is presented by Xiao et al. (2024) with the LD-EnSF method, which performs data assimilation in a latent space to address the limitations of sparse observations in high-dimensional systems. By utilizing Latent Dynamics Networks and LSTM networks, this method accelerates the data assimilation process while maintaining accuracy and robustness. The focus on latent space dynamics and the use of LSTM networks for encoding observations resonate with our work's emphasis on optimizing model coefficients through topological data analysis, as both approaches aim to enhance the assimilation process without explicit noise information [3].

Cheng and Qiu (2021) explored the use of recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTM, to improve the specification of observation error covariance in data assimilation. Their data-driven approach eliminates the need for empirical assumptions about error distribution, offering a more efficient and accurate method for covariance estimation. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to refine key components of data assimilation algorithms, which is a crucial aspect of our research as we seek to optimize model performance without relying on traditional noise statistics [4].

In the context of these advancements, our research introduces a novel data assimilation algorithm grounded in topological data analysis. By focusing on the differentiability of functions of persistence, we employ gradient descent optimization to minimize topological differences between measurements and predictions. This approach not only aligns with the trend of integrating machine learning into data assimilation but also offers a unique perspective by eliminating the need for noise information. Our method's application to the chaotic Lorenz system further demonstrates its potential to enhance prediction accuracy in complex dynamical systems, contributing to the ongoing evolution of data-driven modeling techniques.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models.
Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based
on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time
and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical
data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be
unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological
data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization
is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data
driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method
and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Data assimilation techniques are widely used to predict complex dynamical
systems with uncertainties, based on time-series observation data. Error
covariance matrices modelling is an important element in data assimilation
algorithms which can considerably impact the forecasting accuracy. The
estimation of these covariances, which usually relies on empirical assumptions
and physical constraints, is often imprecise and computationally expensive
especially for systems of large dimension. In this work, we propose a
data-driven approach based on long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
networks (RNN) to improve both the accuracy and the efficiency of observation
covariance specification in data assimilation for dynamical systems. Learning
the covariance matrix from observed/simulated time-series data, the proposed
approach does not require any knowledge or assumption about prior error
distribution, unlike classical posterior tuning methods. We have compared the
novel approach with two state-of-the-art covariance tuning algorithms, namely
DI01 and D05, first in a Lorenz dynamical system and then in a 2D shallow water
twin experiments framework with different covariance parameterization using
ensemble assimilation. This novel method shows significant advantages in
observation covariance specification, assimilation accuracy and computational
efficiency.

        This work explores systems where source updates
require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and
analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various
system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In
parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps
with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series
setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In
practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also
consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do
not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher
update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts
processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series
setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and
solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service
rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We
focus on a special case where updates require two computational

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        An optimal control problem with heterogeneous servers to minimize the average
age of information (AoI) is considered. Each server maintains a separate queue,
and each packet arriving to the system is randomly routed to one of the
servers. Assuming Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed service times,
we first derive an exact expression of the average AoI for two heterogeneous
servers. Next, to solve for the optimal average AoI, a close approximation is
derived, called the approximate AoI, this is shown to be useful for
multi-server systems as well. We show that for the optimal approximate AoI,
server utilization (ratio of arrival rate and service rate) for each server
should be same as the optimal server utilization with a single server queue.
For two identical servers, it is shown that the average AoI is approximately
5/8 times the average AoI of a single server. Furthermore, the average AoI is
shown to decrease considerably with the addition of more servers to the system.

    The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various systems, particularly those involving queuing and network setups. Several studies have explored different configurations and strategies to optimize AoI, providing a foundation for understanding the dynamics of information freshness in complex systems. This section reviews relevant literature, highlighting key contributions and their relation to our research on optimizing AoI in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps.

A significant body of work has focused on AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers. Bhati et al. (2021) investigate an optimal control problem aimed at minimizing the average AoI in systems with multiple servers, each maintaining separate queues. Their study provides exact expressions for average AoI in systems with two heterogeneous servers and extends these findings to multi-server setups, demonstrating that server utilization should be consistent across servers to achieve optimal AoI. This work is relevant to our research as it underscores the importance of server configuration in AoI optimization, particularly in parallel server setups where multiple processors execute computation steps simultaneously (Bhati et al., 2021).

Another line of research examines AoI in tandem queue systems, where information traverses through a series of servers. Sinha et al. (2024) develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak AoI under preemptive and non-preemptive policies in tandem queues with varying service rates. Their findings highlight the impact of server policies on AoI, particularly in series setups where each processor performs specific steps sequentially. Similarly, Yates (2018) explores AoI in networks of preemptive servers, demonstrating how average AoI accumulates through successive nodes in a network. These studies are pertinent to our work as they provide insights into the AoI dynamics in series server setups, where preemption and sequential processing play crucial roles (Sinha et al., 2024; Yates, 2018).

The interplay between processing speed and power consumption in tandem server systems has also been explored. Vaze and Nair (2019) address speed scaling in tandem servers, proposing algorithms that balance power consumption with processing speed to optimize performance. Their work is particularly relevant to our research, which identifies wasted power in systems where processing efforts do not lead to AoI reduction. By considering both worst-case and stochastic settings, Vaze and Nair's study provides a framework for understanding the power-AoI trade-off, which is central to our optimization problem aimed at determining optimal service rates under a power budget (Vaze & Nair, 2019).

In summary, the existing literature provides a comprehensive understanding of AoI optimization in various server configurations, highlighting the importance of server heterogeneity, preemptive policies, and speed scaling. Our research builds on these foundations by modeling and analyzing AoI performance in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps, addressing the age-power trade-off through an optimization framework. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on efficient AoI management in complex systems, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

Several studies have explored different configurations and strategies to optimize AoI, providing a foundation for understanding the dynamics of information freshness in complex systems. This section reviews relevant literature, highlighting key contributions and their relation to our research on optimizing AoI in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps.

A significant body of work has focused on AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers. Bhati et al. (2021) investigate an optimal control problem aimed at minimizing the average AoI in systems with multiple servers, each maintaining separate queues. Their study provides exact expressions for average AoI in systems with two heterogeneous servers and extends these findings to multi-server setups, demonstrating that server utilization should be consistent across servers to achieve optimal AoI. This work is relevant to our research as it underscores the importance of server configuration in AoI optimization, particularly in parallel server setups where multiple processors execute computation steps simultaneously (Bhati et al., 2021).

Another line of research examines AoI in tandem queue systems, where information traverses through a series of servers. Sinha et al. (2024) develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak AoI under preemptive and non-preemptive policies in tandem queues with varying service rates. Their findings highlight the impact of server policies on AoI, particularly in series setups where each processor performs specific steps sequentially. Similarly, Yates (2018) explores AoI in networks of preemptive servers, demonstrating how average AoI accumulates through successive nodes in a network. These studies are pertinent to our work as they provide insights into the AoI dynamics in series server setups, where preemption and sequential processing play crucial roles (Sinha et al., 2024; Yates, 2018).

The interplay between processing speed and power consumption in tandem server systems has also been explored. Vaze and Nair (2019) address speed scaling in tandem servers, proposing algorithms that balance power consumption with processing speed to optimize performance. Their work is particularly relevant to our research, which identifies wasted power in systems where processing efforts do not lead to AoI reduction. By considering both worst-case and stochastic settings, Vaze and Nair's study provides a framework for understanding the power-AoI trade-off, which is central to our optimization problem aimed at determining optimal service rates under a power budget (Vaze & Nair, 2019).

In summary, the existing literature provides a comprehensive understanding of AoI optimization in various server configurations, highlighting the importance of server heterogeneity, preemptive policies, and speed scaling. Our research builds on these foundations by modeling and analyzing AoI performance in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps, addressing the age-power trade-off through an optimization framework. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on efficient AoI management in complex systems, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        This work explores systems where source updates
require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and
analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various
system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In
parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps
with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series
setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In
practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also
consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do
not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher
update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts
processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series
setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and
solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service
rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We
focus on a special case where updates require two computational
steps.

        A source submits status updates to a network for delivery to a destination
monitor. Updates follow a route through a series of network nodes. Each node is
a last-come-first-served queue supporting preemption in service. We
characterize the average age of information at the input and output of each
node in the route induced by the updates passing through. For Poisson arrivals
to a line network of preemptive memoryless servers, we show that average age
accumulates through successive network nodes.

        Speed scaling for a tandem server setting is considered, where there is a
series of servers, and each job has to be processed by each of the servers in
sequence. Servers have a variable speed, their power consumption being a convex
increasing function of the speed. We consider the worst case setting as well as
the stochastic setting. In the worst case setting, the jobs are assumed to be
of unit size with arbitrary (possibly adversarially determined) arrival
instants. For this problem, we devise an online speed scaling algorithm that is
constant competitive with respect to the optimal offline algorithm that has
non-causal information. The proposed algorithm, at all times, uses the same
speed on all active servers, such that the total power consumption equals the
number of outstanding jobs. In the stochastic setting, we consider a more
general tandem network, with a parallel bank of servers at each stage. In this
setting, we show that random routing with a simple gated static speed selection
is constant competitive. In both cases, the competitive ratio depends only on
the power functions, and is independent of the workload and the number of
servers.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical
and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new
families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper,
we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product
used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the
extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate
Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the
vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Distributed storage plays a crucial role in the current cloud computing
framework. After the theoretical bound for distributed storage was derived by
the pioneer work of the regenerating code, Reed-Solomon code based regenerating
codes were developed. The RS code based minimum storage regeneration code
(RS-MSR) and the minimum bandwidth regeneration code (RS-MBR) can achieve
theoretical bounds on the MSR point and the MBR point respectively in code
regeneration. They can also maintain the MDS property in code reconstruction.
However, in the hostile network where the storage nodes can be compromised and
the packets can be tampered with, the storage capacity of the network can be
significantly affected. In this paper, we propose a Hermitian code based
minimum storage regenerating (H-MSR) code and a minimum bandwidth regenerating
(H-MBR) code. We first prove that our proposed Hermitian code based
regenerating codes can achieve the theoretical bounds for MSR point and MBR
point respectively. We then propose data regeneration and reconstruction
algorithms for the H-MSR code and the H-MBR code in both error-free network and
hostile network. Theoretical evaluation shows that our proposed schemes can
detect the erroneous decodings and correct more errors in hostile network than

    Source Abstract:
    Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical
and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new
families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper,
we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product
used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the
extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate
Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the
vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.

    The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research in coding theory, driven by their applicability in various domains such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A significant portion of the literature has focused on enhancing the robustness and efficiency of distributed storage systems, particularly in hostile network environments. For instance, Li et al. (2015) have explored the development of Hermitian code-based regenerating codes that surpass the MDS bound in distributed cloud storage, offering improved error correction capabilities and computational efficiency compared to traditional Reed-Solomon-based codes [1]. Similarly, their subsequent work introduced optimal constructions of regenerating codes through rate-matching, which further enhance error correction efficiency in hostile networks [2]. These contributions underscore the importance of developing codes that can maintain optimal performance under adverse conditions, a theme that resonates with the practical applications of rank-metric codes.

Another critical aspect of rank-metric codes is their security in distributed storage systems. Kadhe and Sprintson (2017) addressed the challenge of designing universally weakly secure coset coding schemes for minimum storage regenerating codes (MSR) [3]. Their work provides a framework for achieving block security without requiring users to know the underlying storage code, thus facilitating the independent design of storage and outer codes. This separation is particularly relevant in scenarios involving third-party cloud storage, where user access to the storage code may be limited. The focus on security highlights the broader applicability of rank-metric codes in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality in distributed systems.

The theoretical foundations and constructions of rank-metric codes have also been extensively studied, with particular attention to their algebraic structures and invariants. Kurz (2021) surveyed known constructions and bounds for subspace codes, which are closely related to rank-metric codes and have applications in network coding and cryptography [4]. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the mathematical underpinnings of subspace codes, offering insights into their potential for error correction and data recovery. Additionally, Gorla et al. (2023) presented the mathematical theory of sum-rank metric codes, an extension of rank-metric codes that incorporates different matrix sizes and explores invariants and optimal anticodes [5]. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the algebraic properties of rank-metric codes, paving the way for novel constructions and applications.

In the context of these existing works, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. This approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape of rank-metric codes but also offers practical tools for distinguishing between different families of codes. From a geometric perspective, our work investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code, providing a fresh lens through which to explore the algebraic structures of these codes. In doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, contributing to the ongoing evolution of rank-metric codes in coding theory.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Regenerating code is a class of code very suitable for distributed storage
systems, which can maintain optimal bandwidth and storage space. Two types of
important regenerating code have been constructed: the minimum storage
regeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code.
However, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes,
the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this
paper, we propose two optimal constructions of regenerating codes through
rate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile
networks: 2-layer rate-matched regenerating code and $m$-layer rate-matched
regenerating code. For the 2-layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage
efficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that
our code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency
compared to the universally resilient regenerating code which is a
straightforward extension of regenerating code with error detection and
correction capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the
2-layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching
the code rate of each layer's regenerating code. We also demonstrate that the
optimized parameter can achieve the maximum storage capacity under the same
constraint. Compared to the universally resilient regenerating code, our code
can achieve much higher error correction efficiency.

        We consider the problem of designing codes for distributed storage that
protect user data against eavesdroppers that can gain access to network links
as well as individual nodes. Our goal is to achieve weak security (also known
as block security) that requires that the eavesdroppers would not be able to
decode individual files or combinations of a small number of files. The
standard approach for achieving block security is to use a joint design scheme
that consists of (inner) storage code and the (outer) coset code. However,
jointly designing the codes requires that the user, who pre-processes and
stores the files, should know the underlying storage code in order to design
the (outer) linear transformation for achieving weak security. In many
practical scenarios, such as storing the files on the third party cloud storage
system, it may not be possible for the user to know the underlying storage
code.
  In this work, we present universal schemes that separate the outer code
design from the storage code design for minimum storage regenerating codes
(MSR). Our schemes allow the independent design of the storage code and the
outer code. Our schemes use small field size and can be used in a broad range
of practical settings.

        Subspace codes are the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming
metric. Here the codewords are vector spaces over a finite field. They have
e.g. applications in random linear network coding, distributed storage, and
cryptography. In this chapter we survey known constructions and upper bounds

    The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research in coding theory, driven by their applicability in various domains such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A significant portion of the literature has focused on enhancing the robustness and efficiency of distributed storage systems, particularly in hostile network environments. For instance, Li et al. (2015) have explored the development of Hermitian code-based regenerating codes that surpass the MDS bound in distributed cloud storage, offering improved error correction capabilities and computational efficiency compared to traditional Reed-Solomon-based codes [1]. Similarly, their subsequent work introduced optimal constructions of regenerating codes through rate-matching, which further enhance error correction efficiency in hostile networks [2]. These contributions underscore the importance of developing codes that can maintain optimal performance under adverse conditions, a theme that resonates with the practical applications of rank-metric codes.

Another critical aspect of rank-metric codes is their security in distributed storage systems. Kadhe and Sprintson (2017) addressed the challenge of designing universally weakly secure coset coding schemes for minimum storage regenerating codes (MSR) [3]. Their work provides a framework for achieving block security without requiring users to know the underlying storage code, thus facilitating the independent design of storage and outer codes. This separation is particularly relevant in scenarios involving third-party cloud storage, where user access to the storage code may be limited. The focus on security highlights the broader applicability of rank-metric codes in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality in distributed systems.

The theoretical foundations and constructions of rank-metric codes have also been extensively studied, with particular attention to their algebraic structures and invariants. Kurz (2021) surveyed known constructions and bounds for subspace codes, which are closely related to rank-metric codes and have applications in network coding and cryptography [4]. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the mathematical underpinnings of subspace codes, offering insights into their potential for error correction and data recovery. Additionally, Gorla et al. (2023) presented the mathematical theory of sum-rank metric codes, an extension of rank-metric codes that incorporates different matrix sizes and explores invariants and optimal anticodes [5]. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the algebraic properties of rank-metric codes, paving the way for novel constructions and applications.

In the context of these existing works, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. This approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape of rank-metric codes but also offers practical tools for distinguishing between different families of codes. From a geometric perspective, our work investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code, providing a fresh lens through which to explore the algebraic structures of these codes. In doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, contributing to the ongoing evolution of rank-metric codes in coding theory.
