Traditional benchmarks like HumanEval have been instrumental in assessing these models, yet they exhibit limitations such as data leakage and a lack of problem variety, which can lead to overfitting and an inflated sense of model proficiency. The introduction of EvoEval by Chunqiu Steven Xia et al. (2024) addresses these concerns by providing a more diverse set of challenges, revealing a notable performance drop in LLMs when faced with this benchmark. This aligns with our findings, which question the reliability of current benchmarks by demonstrating that LLMs struggle with tracing execution paths, particularly in complex code structures. Both studies underscore the necessity for more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess the code reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

The issue of code hallucinations, where LLMs generate code that is syntactically and semantically plausible but fails to execute as intended, further complicates the evaluation of these models. Yuchen Tian et al. (2024) introduce CodeHalu, a detection algorithm that categorizes and evaluates these hallucinations, complementing our research by highlighting the limitations of LLMs in generating reliable code. While our study focuses on the models' ability to trace execution paths, the broader context provided by CodeHalu emphasizes the challenges LLMs face in code reasoning and execution. This theme is echoed in the work of Wei Ma et al. (2023), who explore the limitations of LLMs in software engineering tasks, particularly in understanding dynamic semantics and their susceptibility to hallucinations, further reinforcing the need for improved code reasoning capabilities.

The need for robust evaluation metrics is also highlighted by Weixiang Yan et al. (2023) through the introduction of CodeScope, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs across multiple programming languages and tasks. This work parallels our proposed CoCoNUT benchmark, which focuses on execution traceability, emphasizing the importance of evaluating LLMs on diverse and complex programming tasks to better understand their capabilities and limitations. Similarly, Jiasheng Zheng et al. (2024) propose the RACE benchmark, advocating for a multidimensional evaluation of LLMs beyond mere correctness, which aligns with our findings on the inadequacy of current benchmarks in capturing the multifaceted requirements of real-world code analysis.

The exploration of LLMs' code reasoning capabilities is further advanced by Arkil Patel et al. (2023) with the CodeMind framework, which evaluates models on tasks like Independent Execution Reasoning and Specification Reasoning. This work highlights the gap between code generation and reasoning, particularly in tracing execution paths and understanding advanced code structures, a theme that resonates with our research. Hung Le et al. (2023) propose CodeChain, a framework that enhances modular code generation through iterative self-revisions, contrasting with the monolithic code generation tendency of LLMs. Both studies emphasize the need for improved code reasoning capabilities, with CodeChain focusing on modularity and our research emphasizing execution trace comprehension.

Finally, the limitations of traditional language-to-code benchmarks are further explored by Yuwei Zhao et al. (2024) through the introduction of CodeJudge-Eval, which assesses LLMs' code understanding abilities by evaluating their capacity to judge the correctness of code solutions. This approach reveals that current LLMs struggle with deeper code reasoning tasks, such as execution trace matching and code judging, similar to the challenges identified in our work with the CoCoNUT benchmark. Both studies highlight the ongoing challenge of bridging the gap between LLM-generated code and human-like comprehension of code structure and flow, indicating a need for improved evaluation methods to enhance LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.","Weixiang Yan, Haitian Liu, Yunkun Wang, Yunzhe Li, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Tingyu Lin, Weishan Zhao, Li Zhu, Hari Sundaram, Shuiguang Deng (2023).

A significant body of work has explored the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance trust in ML processes. Xing et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive survey of zero-knowledge proof-based verifiable machine learning (ZKP-VML) technologies, addressing trustworthiness issues in outsourced model training and inference. Their work offers a formal definition and classification of ZKP-VML approaches, which aligns with our research focus on using zkSNARKs to ensure verifiable and tamper-proof inference in distributed ML settings. Both studies aim to enhance trust in ML computations through zero-knowledge proofs, highlighting the potential of these techniques in addressing verifiability challenges (Xing et al., 2023).

Privacy-preserving distributed ML inference has been another area of active research, with several studies proposing cryptographic techniques to protect model parameters and data. Fung et al. (2018) introduce privateMDI, a protocol that uses model parallelization at edge servers to enhance inference speed while maintaining privacy through additive secret sharing and homomorphic encryption. Similarly, Dehkordi et al. (2024) present a privacy-preserving ML inference protocol for hierarchical setups, focusing on model-distributed inference and minimizing communication. Both works emphasize reducing communication overhead and ensuring privacy, complementing our approach that employs zkSNARKs for verifiable inference. While these studies focus on different cryptographic techniques, they share a common goal of enhancing trust and privacy in distributed ML environments (Fung et al., 2018; Dehkordi et al., 2024).

The importance of privacy and verifiability in ML as a service (MLaaS) is further underscored by Riasi et al. (2024), who introduce vPIN, a privacy-preserving and verifiable CNN inference scheme using partial homomorphic encryption and commit-and-prove techniques. This work relates to our research by highlighting the need for privacy and verifiability in distributed ML settings, similar to our focus on ensuring partial privacy of model parameters during inference using zkSNARKs. Additionally, the work of Lycklama et al. (2024) on Commit-and-Prove SNARK constructions for zkML pipelines offers advancements in commitment verification that could enhance the efficiency and scalability of zkML techniques, potentially benefiting our approach (Riasi et al., 2024; Lycklama et al., 2024).

Several studies have also addressed privacy concerns in federated and decentralized learning. Gu et al. (2021) introduce the PRECAD framework, which combines differential privacy and robustness against model poisoning attacks using secure multi-party computation. This approach complements our research by emphasizing the need for robust privacy solutions in distributed ML environments. Similarly, Meng and Feigenbaum (2020) present Shatter, a system that enhances privacy through model chunking and virtualization, preventing full model access and identity exposure. Both works underscore the challenges and potential solutions for maintaining privacy and trust in ML deployments, aligning with our focus on model parameter privacy during inference (Gu et al., 2021; Meng & Feigenbaum, 2020).

Finally, the vulnerabilities in ML models due to data poisoning, as highlighted by Colombo et al. (2024), emphasize the importance of protecting model parameters during inference, especially in distributed settings. Their findings on the interplay between data poisoning and privacy leakage underscore the need for robust privacy-preserving techniques throughout the ML lifecycle. This is relevant to our work, which focuses on using zkSNARKs for partial privacy in ML inference. Additionally, Nawaz et al. (2020) present Otak, a system that enhances ML inference efficiency using a novel two-party secure computation protocol and limited trusted hardware, focusing on input privacy. While our research addresses parameter privacy, both studies highlight the potential of zkSNARKs in achieving verifiable ML model execution (Colombo et al., 2024; Nawaz et al., 2020).","Mathieu N Galtier, Camille Marini (2019).

This research direction is motivated by the high energy consumption of Transformer architectures, which are widely used in NLP tasks. Several studies have investigated the integration of SNNs with Transformer models to address this challenge. For instance, the work by Xing et al. (2024) introduces SpikeLM, a fully spike-driven model for general language tasks, which proposes a bi-directional, elastic spike formulation to overcome the limitations of binary spikes in existing SNNs. This approach is relevant to our research on SpikeDecoder, as it provides insights into spike encoding and optimization strategies that could inform our efforts to reduce energy consumption and improve performance in spike-based models (Xing et al., 2024).

The integration of SNNs with Transformers has also been explored in the context of ANN-to-SNN conversion and novel training methods. Wang et al. (2022) focus on energy efficiency and performance improvements through ANN-to-SNN conversion and introduce a Random Spike Masking method. While their work primarily addresses vision tasks, it highlights the potential of SNNs in NLP, aligning with our research on developing SpikeDecoder for NLP applications (Wang et al., 2022). Similarly, Hu et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive survey of SNNs, categorizing learning methods and network architectures, including ANN-to-SNN conversion and direct training with surrogate gradients. Their discussion on spiking self-attention mechanisms and the challenges of integrating Transformer architectures into SNNs directly relates to our exploration of spike-based alternatives in Transformer models for NLP (Hu et al., 2024).

The challenge of encoding text into spike trains for energy-efficient processing in SNNs has been addressed by several studies. You et al. (2024) explore various encoding methods, including binarization and rate-coding, to improve performance in sentiment analysis tasks. This work is relevant to our research as it provides insights into embedding techniques that could be applied to our SpikeDecoder model (You et al., 2024). Similarly, Knipper et al. (2024) propose a new method for encoding text into spike trains, which improves performance over existing techniques. Their emphasis on encoding methods complements our investigation into embedding techniques for spike-based models (Knipper et al., 2024).

The development of energy-efficient spiking language models has been further explored through the implementation of large language models using SNNs. Zhu et al. (2023) introduce SpikeGPT, a generative language model with spiking activation units, demonstrating competitive performance with significantly reduced computational operations. This aligns with our research on SpikeDecoder, as both works aim to leverage the energy-efficient properties of SNNs for language models (Zhu et al., 2023). Additionally, Bal et al. (2024) introduce a novel binary/ternary spiking language model architecture, utilizing knowledge distillation from a non-spiking teacher model to a spiking student model. While their work primarily addresses text classification tasks, it complements our research by demonstrating the feasibility of transferring knowledge from large language models to spiking architectures (Bal et al., 2024).

Finally, the integration of SNNs with Transformers to enhance energy efficiency and performance has been explored by Zhou et al. (2023), who introduce Spikingformer, a pure transformer-based SNN. This model effectively reduces energy consumption and outperforms previous models by implementing a spike-driven residual learning architecture. This work is relevant to our research as it highlights the potential of SNNs in reducing energy consumption in Transformer models, similar to our proposed SpikeDecoder, and provides insights into overcoming challenges associated with non-spike computations and residual connections in SNN-based Transformers (Zhou et al., 2023). Collectively, these studies underscore the potential of SNNs in achieving energy-efficient NLP models and provide valuable insights that inform the development of our SpikeDecoder model.","Kang You, Zekai Xu, Chen Nie, Zhijie Deng, Qinghai Guo, Xiang Wang, Zhezhi He (2024).

A notable contribution in this area is the development of Audio-Visual LLM, which integrates visual and auditory inputs to enhance video comprehension. This approach aligns with our research focus on extending image-based MLLMs to video domains, particularly through modality-augmented training and the use of high-quality video instruction datasets. While the Audio-Visual LLM achieves strong zero-shot results, our study emphasizes efficient training with reduced sample sizes and improved long video comprehension (Fangxun Shu et al., 2023). Similarly, the integration of image and video encoders in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance video understanding, as explored in VideoGPT+, addresses limitations in spatial and temporal context processing. This complements our approach by highlighting the importance of combining spatial and temporal information and the need for diverse data and efficient training strategies (Muhammad Maaz et al., 2024).

Another significant theme in the literature is the challenge of efficiently representing and processing video data. The Video-LaVIT paper proposes an efficient video decomposition method that represents videos as keyframes and temporal motions, which aligns with our exploration of enhancing instruction diversity for improved training efficiency. Both works aim to improve the comprehension and generation capabilities of LLMs in video contexts, with a focus on spatiotemporal dynamics and data augmentation (Yang Jin et al., 2024). Additionally, the introduction of VideoNIAH, a benchmark construction framework using synthetic video generation, addresses inefficiencies in current benchmarks and highlights challenges in video understanding, such as temporal perception and spatio-temporal coherence. This is closely related to our T2Vid method, which also aims to improve these aspects by enriching instruction diversity (Zijia Zhao et al., 2024).

The understanding of long videos presents unique challenges, as addressed by several works. The LVBench benchmark highlights the limitations of current multimodal models in comprehending extended video content, which aligns with our identification of limited temporal understanding capabilities in existing models. Our T2Vid method aims to enhance instruction diversity and improve video comprehension, complementing the benchmark's focus on evaluating long video understanding capabilities (Weihan Wang et al., 2024). Similarly, the Visual Context Window Extension paper proposes a progressive pooling inference strategy to manage memory consumption and improve performance without retraining on long video datasets. This approach, which extends the visual context window of LMMs, aligns with our focus on improving video understanding using MLLMs through data augmentation (Hongchen Wei and Zhenzhong Chen, 2024).

The integration of video-specific information into LLM-based frameworks is another area of interest, as explored in the work on understanding long videos with multimodal language models. This research achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-video understanding tasks by leveraging object-centric modalities and natural language fusion, addressing the challenge of limited video data. While this work uses off-the-shelf vision tools for data extraction, our approach focuses on synthesizing video-like samples to enrich instruction diversity, offering a complementary perspective on optimizing video understanding with limited data (Kanchana Ranasinghe et al., 2024). Furthermore, the introduction of TimeSuite, a framework that adapts short-form video MLLMs for long video comprehension, complements our research by providing grounding-centric datasets and instruction tuning tasks that could enhance the temporal understanding aspects identified as limitations in our study (Xiangyu Zeng et al., 2024).

Finally, the development of comprehensive benchmarks such as MVBench, designed to evaluate the temporal understanding capabilities of MLLMs in video tasks, addresses a gap in existing benchmarks that focus primarily on static image tasks. This aligns with our research, which also explores the limitations of current MLLMs in video understanding, particularly in terms of temporal comprehension. Our study proposes a data augmentation method to enhance instruction diversity and efficiency in training, while the MVBench provides a robust baseline to assess advancements in video understanding (Kunchang Li et al., 2023). Similarly, MiniGPT4-Video extends the capabilities of image-based models to process sequences of frames for video comprehension, aligning with our research on leveraging pre-trained image-LLMs for video understanding. Both approaches aim to advance video understanding by building on the success of image-based MLLMs, with a focus on enhancing instruction diversity and training efficiency (Kirolos Ataallah et al., 2024).","Hongchen Wei, Zhenzhong Chen (2024).

A prominent theme in recent research is the distillation of reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller models. Jinwei He and Feng Lu (2024) explore this through a Socratic Chain of Thought (CoT) method, which decomposes problems into subproblems, aligning with the Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework's use of forward-backward reasoning to improve reasoning performance. Similarly, Kaituo Feng et al. (2024) introduce Keypoint-based Progressive Chain-of-Thought Distillation (KPOD), which addresses token significance and learning order, complementing REVTHINK's multi-task learning approach by emphasizing structured learning and reasoning consistency. Both studies highlight the potential for efficient reasoning skill transfer from large to small models, showcasing complementary strategies for enhancing reasoning performance (He & Lu, 2024; Feng et al., 2024).

Another significant area of research focuses on integrating external knowledge and addressing reasoning challenges such as hallucinations and information loss. Keheng Wang et al. (2023) present Knowledge-Driven Chain-of-Thought (KD-CoT), which enhances LLM reasoning by integrating external knowledge to verify and modify reasoning traces. This approach parallels REVTHINK's goal of improving reasoning through structured processes, albeit through different methodologies. Jiachun Li et al. (2024) address the ""Toxic CoT"" problem with RIDERS, a method to enhance information retention during reasoning, complementing REVTHINK's focus on reverse reasoning by highlighting the importance of robust reasoning frameworks in LLMs. Both studies underscore the necessity of innovative methods to enhance reasoning capabilities and mitigate reasoning deficits in language models (Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024).

The exploration of diverse reasoning strategies is another critical theme in the literature. Zeming Chen et al. (2023) introduce BRAINTEASER, a benchmark for evaluating lateral thinking in language models, which contrasts with traditional vertical reasoning tasks. This aligns with REVTHINK's emphasis on reverse thinking, as both approaches aim to challenge default reasoning patterns and enhance reasoning capabilities. Similarly, Liunian Harold Li et al. (2023) explore Symbolic Chain-of-Thought Distillation (SCoTD), which focuses on sampling diverse reasoning chains to improve reasoning in smaller models. These studies highlight the importance of diverse reasoning strategies in advancing language model capabilities, demonstrating complementary approaches to augmenting reasoning performance (Chen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).

In the context of optimizing reasoning steps and learning from mistakes, Chengwei Dai et al. (2024) introduce EDIT, a method that distills key reasoning steps into smaller language models by analyzing mistakes. This complements REVTHINK's framework by emphasizing the identification and optimization of crucial reasoning steps through dual Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) data. Eric Zelikman et al. (2024) present Quiet-STaR, which enhances language models' reasoning by generating rationales for each token, improving predictions without task-specific fine-tuning. Both approaches aim to enhance reasoning capabilities in language models, with REVTHINK leveraging reverse thinking and EDIT focusing on mistake-driven learning, showcasing the potential of structured reasoning processes in language models (Dai et al., 2024; Zelikman et al., 2024).

Finally, the challenge of maintaining generalization and robustness in language models is addressed by Kaixin Ma et al. (2021), who explore strategies for adapting pre-trained language models to commonsense reasoning tasks. They highlight the limitations of fine-tuning due to overfitting and reduced generalization, investigating alternative methods like prefix-tuning and autoprompt. This relates to REVTHINK's approach of enhancing reasoning through structured forward-backward reasoning and multi-task learning objectives, emphasizing the importance of maintaining generalization and robustness in language models. Both works address the challenge of improving model performance while avoiding overfitting and ensuring adaptability to novel tasks, underscoring the need for innovative strategies in model training (Ma et al., 2021).","Keheng Wang, Feiyu Duan, Sirui Wang, Peiguang Li, Yunsen Xian, Chuantao Yin, Wenge Rong, Zhang Xiong (2023).

A significant portion of this literature addresses the sender's strategic use of information to influence receiver actions, often under conditions of uncertainty. For instance, Zu et al. (2021) investigate the challenge of persuasion in online platforms where the sender must learn and persuade simultaneously without prior knowledge of the distribution, achieving low regret through robustly-persuasive algorithms. This work complements our research by focusing on the sender's commitment power in communication mechanisms, particularly in contexts like Web 3.0 communities, where trust and credibility are crucial. Similarly, Babichenko et al. (2023) explore strategic communication in environments where neither the sender nor the receiver knows the distribution of the payoff-relevant state, aligning with our interest in enhancing sender payoffs through strategic communication under uncertainty.

The computational aspects of Bayesian persuasion models are another critical area of related research. Gradwohl et al. (2020) delve into the sender's optimization problem in various input models, providing algorithmic solutions and complexity results that are crucial for understanding the tractability of designing optimal signaling schemes. This work is particularly relevant to our study as it addresses the computational challenges in strategic communication, especially in scenarios where the sender's commitment power is enhanced through money-burning tactics. Dughmi and Xu (2015) also contribute to this theme by examining the computational complexity and optimal strategies in persuasion, offering foundational insights into the sender's strategic information disclosure, which is essential for designing communication mechanisms that incorporate money-burning tactics.

The dynamics of sender commitment and trust are further explored in the context of multiple senders and competitive environments. Zhang et al. (2023) highlight how competition among senders affects the information disclosed to the receiver, emphasizing the challenges of sender commitment and trust. This relates to our research by underscoring the importance of commitment mechanisms, such as money-burning tactics, to enhance sender credibility and improve equilibrium payoffs. Su and Subramanian (2022) extend this discussion by investigating the impact of commitment order in Bayesian persuasion games with multiple senders, providing insights into how commitment order affects equilibrium payoffs in multi-sender settings. These studies collectively emphasize the strategic importance of commitment power, a key element in our model of mediated communication.

The notion of credibility in Bayesian persuasion is another pertinent theme. Lin and Liu (2022) introduce a new concept of credibility, focusing on the sender's inability to profit from tampering with messages while maintaining the same distribution. This concept aligns with our exploration of money-burning tactics to enhance commitment power, highlighting the constraints on the sender's ability to persuade when the payoff is state-independent. Arieli et al. (2022) further contribute to this discussion by examining a mediated communication framework that characterizes implementable action distributions, providing an efficient algorithm for computing optimal equilibria. These works collectively contribute to understanding the limitations and potential of enhanced communication strategies in scenarios where commitment is valuable.

Finally, the exploration of sender's preferred equilibria and equilibrium payoff sets in verifiable disclosure games, as examined by Zhang (2022), provides a foundation for understanding strategic communication, which is relevant to our study of communication mechanisms in Web 3.0 communities. This work contrasts with our finding that money-burning tactics can enhance commitment power and improve the sender's payoff, offering a different perspective on sender commitment and payoff optimization. Che et al. (2020) also explore the challenges of maintaining engagement without full commitment power, complementing our investigation into how money-burning tactics can enhance commitment power in communication. Together, these studies contribute to the broader literature on strategic communication and Bayesian persuasion, with differing approaches to sender commitment and payoff optimization.","Kun Zhang (2022).

A central theme in this domain is the exploration of voting rules that maintain Condorcet consistency while addressing paradoxical outcomes. Holliday and Pacuit (2023) extend May's Theorem to three alternatives, characterizing Minimax as a preferred voting method due to its immunity to the strong no-show paradox, which aligns with our findings on the robustness of maximin refinements in three-candidate elections (Holliday & Pacuit, 2023). Similarly, Carlstein (2020) delves into the strategic manipulation and participation properties of voting rules, highlighting the limitations of Condorcet extensions, which resonate with our investigation into the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes (Carlstein, 2020). These works collectively underscore the challenges in achieving desirable properties in voting systems, particularly in the context of strategic vulnerabilities and paradoxes.

The necessity of Condorcet consistency (CC) is another critical aspect explored in the literature. Darlington (2017) argues for the essential nature of CC by dismissing conflicting electoral criteria and emphasizing the superiority of majority rule in two-candidate elections, which complements our research on the vulnerabilities of Condorcet extensions to paradoxes like the no-show paradox (Darlington, 2017). This theme is further echoed in Xia's (2021) work, which discusses the limitations of alternative voting systems lacking CC, reinforcing the significance of our findings on the robustness of Condorcet extensions (Xia, 2021). These discussions provide a broader context for understanding the importance of CC in maintaining fair election outcomes and the challenges faced by Condorcet extensions in variable-electorate settings.

The exploration of axiomatic characterizations and refinements of voting rules is another focal point in the literature. Holliday et al. (2022) investigate the tension between binary expansion consistency and weakenings of resoluteness, highlighting the challenges of maintaining fairness and consistency in voting rules, particularly in the presence of variable-candidate axioms (Holliday et al., 2022). This is relevant to our research on Condorcet extensions, as it provides insights into the limitations and paradoxes faced by these voting rules. Similarly, Brandt et al. (2016) explore the compatibility of Condorcet-consistency and participation, demonstrating the challenges faced by Condorcet extensions in variable-electorate settings, which aligns with our focus on axiomatic characterizations and refinements of voting rules like maximin, Nanson’s rule, and leximin (Brandt et al., 2016).

The Split Cycle method, introduced by Holliday and Pacuit (2020), offers an alternative approach to handling paradoxes in voting rules by adhering to axioms for determining candidate defeats, including a weakened version of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (Holliday & Pacuit, 2020). This method's focus on axiomatic properties and cycle-resolving rules complements our investigation into the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to paradoxes, particularly in three-candidate elections. Krukowski (2023) further explores the Split Cycle method, highlighting its adherence to desirable criteria such as immunity to spoilers and positive involvement, which are relevant to the paradoxes discussed in our research (Krukowski, 2023). These works collectively offer insights into refining voting rules to address paradoxical outcomes, aligning with our analysis of maximin and its refinements.

Finally, the manipulability of Condorcet-consistent voting rules is a significant concern addressed in the literature. Peters (2017) demonstrates that any Condorcet-consistent rule can be manipulated by a voter reversing their preference ranking when there are at least four alternatives, highlighting vulnerabilities in these voting rules (Peters, 2017). This finding is relevant to our research on Condorcet extensions, as it provides a broader context for understanding the limitations of Condorcet-consistent rules. The exploration of strategic manipulation and its implications for voting systems contributes to the discourse on the robustness and strategic vulnerabilities of voting systems, complementing our focus on the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in three-candidate elections.","Dominik Peters (2017).

A significant body of work has focused on the dynamics of chaotic coupled map lattices, particularly those involving Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories. Torcini and Lepri (1996) explored the propagation of perturbations in these systems, emphasizing the role of Lyapunov exponents in describing the exponential spread of perturbations. Their insights into the symplectic structure and chaotic properties of cat map lattices offer a valuable perspective for analyzing the ballistic and diffusive behaviors observed in our model (Torcini & Lepri, 1996). Similarly, Axenides et al. (2022) constructed Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, examining chaotic diffusion in nonlinear Hamiltonian systems and providing a theoretical framework for understanding chaotic diffusion and ergodic properties in coupled cat map lattices (Axenides, Floratos, & Nicolis, 2022).

The transition from ballistic to diffusive transport in chaotic systems is a recurring theme in the literature. Moges et al. (2021) investigated the diffusion and chaos properties of single and coupled standard maps, focusing on anomalous diffusion caused by accelerator modes. Their work aligns with our study of diffusive transport in phase space due to chaos in a lattice of coupled cat maps, emphasizing the role of chaos in influencing diffusion properties (Moges, Manos, & Skokos, 2021). Kaneko (1993) also explored the dynamics of traveling waves and phase slips in coupled map lattices, highlighting the global impact of local perturbations and the coexistence of attractors with different velocities. This study provides insights into how local perturbations in a lattice of coupled cat maps can lead to global effects, such as the ballistic spread of perturbations and diffusive transport in phase space (Kaneko, 1993).

The influence of coupling forms on chaotic dynamics and stability has been another area of interest. Ginelli et al. (2001) demonstrated that nonlinear coupling can enhance the stability of spatiotemporal fixed points in coupled chaotic systems. While our work focuses on the diffusion resulting from microscopic chaos in a lattice of coupled cat maps, their study offers a complementary perspective on controlling chaos in spatially extended systems through nonlinear coupling (Ginelli, Livi, & Politi, 2001). Similarly, Groote and Beck (2006) investigated diffusively coupled Tchebyscheff maps, focusing on their chaotic behavior and the scaling of observables in the low-coupling limit. Their analysis of Lyapunov exponents and invariant densities complements our findings on ergodic properties and diffusive transport in phase space (Groote & Beck, 2006).

The role of chaos in influencing transport properties is further explored in studies examining the statistical and dynamical characteristics of chaotic systems. Fukai and Takeuchi (2021) demonstrated that deterministic chaotic perturbations in a logistic coupled map lattice follow universal statistical laws akin to those in stochastic KPZ systems. Their findings on geometry-dependent statistical laws and the transition to Lyapunov vectors offer insights into the behavior of chaotic systems, complementing our study of ergodic properties and perturbation spread (Fukai & Takeuchi, 2021). Katzav and Cugliandolo (2005) explored the continuum space-time limit of a periodic one-dimensional array of deterministic logistic maps coupled diffusively, drawing parallels with the stochastic KPZ equation for surface fluctuations. Their work provides insights into the behavior of coupled chaotic systems and their diffusion properties, aligning with our study of ergodic properties and diffusive transport in a lattice of coupled cat maps (Katzav & Cugliandolo, 2005).

Finally, the computation of correlation functions in chaotic maps, including the cat map, has been investigated by Hu and Rosenhaus (2022). Their examination of correlation functions through various methods complements our work by providing insights into the microscopic chaos that underlies diffusive transport (Hu & Rosenhaus, 2022). Sonawane (2010) explored a lattice model with stochastic coupling, investigating the interplay between deterministic chaos and external influences, such as noise or coupling, to understand the resulting transport and stability properties in complex systems. This study parallels our investigation of a lattice of coupled cat maps where local perturbations spread and induce chaotic fluctuations (Sonawane, 2010). Collectively, these studies underscore the broader theme of understanding diffusion through microscopic chaotic dynamics, providing a rich context for our research on the ergodic properties and diffusive transport in a lattice of coupled cat maps.","Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos, Stam Nicolis (2022).

This research area is particularly relevant to our work, which introduces a novel data assimilation algorithm based on topological data analysis to optimize machine learning models without relying on noise statistics. Several studies have explored similar themes, focusing on improving model accuracy and robustness in chaotic systems like the Lorenz model.

A significant body of work has concentrated on combining data assimilation with machine learning to address the challenges posed by chaotic systems. Bocquet et al. (2020) propose a Bayesian framework that merges data assimilation and machine learning through expectation-maximization to reconstruct high-dimensional chaotic dynamics from partial and noisy observations. This approach aligns with our research focus on enhancing data-driven models without known noise statistics, although it employs neural-network representations and state-of-the-art assimilation schemes to infer hidden dynamics and model parameters. Similarly, Wikner et al. (2021) explore a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning with a knowledge-based model to correct model imperfections, emphasizing the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-based components to improve forecasting in chaotic systems. Both studies utilize the Lorenz system as a test case, underscoring the relevance of their methodologies in handling chaotic dynamics.

Other researchers have explored variational data assimilation and hybrid modeling approaches to improve predictions in chaotic systems. Frerix et al. (2021) employ a learned inverse observation operator to enhance the initialization and optimization of the initial state in chaotic systems, transforming the optimization problem into a more manageable physics space. This aligns with our focus on refining data assimilation techniques to better capture complex system dynamics. De Florio et al. (2023) present a hybrid neural-physics modeling approach that combines machine learning and data assimilation to address incomplete dynamical systems, particularly when the underlying physics is not fully understood. Both studies highlight the potential of integrating machine learning with data assimilation to improve prediction accuracy, similar to our approach of minimizing topological differences to enhance model performance.

Reinforcement learning and neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) have also been explored as alternative methods for improving predictions in chaotic systems. Hammoud et al. (2024) introduce a novel data assimilation strategy using reinforcement learning to enhance model forecasts by minimizing the root-mean-squared error between observations and forecasts. This contrasts with traditional methods like the ensemble Kalman filter by addressing limitations such as non-Gaussian data assimilation. Chakraborty et al. (2024) explore the use of NODEs for forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, introducing a training approach that enhances the learning of chaotic systems by penalizing trajectory discontinuities. Both studies complement our research by providing alternative methods for optimizing model coefficients without relying on noise information.

Finally, several studies have focused on model identification and parameter estimation in chaotic systems. Ribera et al. (2021) explore model identification for chaotic systems with unmeasured variables by combining variational annealing and sparse optimization methods, successfully recovering equations from experimental data with hidden variables. Raissi et al. (2018) present a machine learning framework, CODA, for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data, emphasizing the integration of deep neural networks with classical numerical methods to enhance predictive accuracy. Carlson et al. (2021) develop an algorithm for dynamically learning parameters of chaotic systems from partial observations, demonstrating convergence to correct parameters under certain conditions. These studies address the challenge of parameter estimation in chaotic systems, a key aspect of data assimilation, and complement our approach by offering insights into parameter learning in chaotic dynamics.

In summary, the integration of data assimilation and machine learning has been extensively explored in the context of chaotic systems, with various approaches focusing on improving model accuracy and robustness. Our research contributes to this field by introducing a novel data assimilation algorithm based on topological data analysis, offering a unique perspective on optimizing machine learning models without relying on noise statistics. The related works discussed here provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven models with data assimilation techniques to enhance predictions in complex dynamical systems.","H.

Liu and Ji (2019) delve into the trade-off between service performance and information freshness in data-driven real-time services, proposing scheduling policies that align closely with my research focus on optimizing service rates under power constraints. Their work on energy management in Online Data-Intensive (OLDI) applications parallels my investigation into the age-power trade-off, highlighting the shared objective of enhancing system efficiency through strategic resource allocation. Similarly, Liu et al. (2013) employ queuing theory to identify optimal processing speed and system settings for power efficiency, complementing my study by emphasizing the importance of finding ""sweet spots"" in power-efficient operations that balance processing speed and power consumption.

The challenge of optimizing AoI in systems with heterogeneous service times is further explored by Gamgam et al. (2023), who address the scheduling problem in multi-source single-server systems. Their insights into age-agnostic schedulers and service discipline models in G/G/1/1 systems provide a foundational understanding of AoI dynamics that can inform the development of efficient processing step sequences in my research. This complements the work of Inoue et al. (2018), who offer a comprehensive analysis of AoI behavior under different queuing models, including preemptive and non-preemptive LCFS disciplines. Their findings are crucial for understanding the age-power trade-offs in series server setups, as they provide a theoretical basis for optimizing service rates in my study.

The intersection of power management and AoI optimization is a recurring theme in the literature, with several studies addressing the trade-offs between performance and resource usage. Cesarini et al. (2019) focus on reducing power consumption in high-performance computing without altering application source code, a concept that resonates with my work on identifying wasted power in processing updates. Their approach to managing power consumption through communication slack complements my study of optimizing service rates to balance AoI and power usage. Bastopcu and Ulukus (2019) also investigate power management strategies in HPC applications, emphasizing power savings during idle times, which aligns with my research on enhancing system efficiency by balancing computational speed and energy usage.

The trade-off between computation and communication is another critical aspect of AoI optimization, as highlighted by Zou et al. (2019) and Akturk and Karpuzcu (2017). Zou et al. explore tandem queues and the trade-offs between computation and transmission times, providing insights into queue management and AoI metrics that complement my investigation into optimizing processing steps under power constraints. Akturk and Karpuzcu's taxonomy of trading computation for communication underscores the importance of balancing computational resources to achieve optimal system performance, a concept that aligns with my focus on the age-power trade-off in processing systems.

Finally, the exploration of AoI in systems using the Processor Sharing (PS) discipline by Gandarias et al. (2023) offers valuable insights into how simultaneous service of updates can impact AoI, particularly in M/M/1/2 and M/M/1 queue models. Their emphasis on efficient resource management and energy efficiency complements my work on identifying and mitigating wasted power in processing setups, reinforcing the shared goal of optimizing service rates to balance age and power consumption. Collectively, these studies provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between AoI, power consumption, and system performance, informing the development of effective strategies for optimizing sequential processing steps in my research.","Melih Bastopcu, Sennur Ulukus (2019).

A central theme in recent research is the development of invariants to distinguish between different families of rank-metric codes. Neri, Puchinger, and Horlemann-Trautmann (2019) provide a framework for distinguishing rank-metric codes using sequences of dimensions generated by field automorphisms, which serve as criteria for code inequivalence. This approach is closely related to our research, which introduces a novel geometric invariant inspired by the Schur product, as both methods aim to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones through algebraic structures (Neri et al., 2019). Similarly, Couvreur, Debris-Alazard, and Gaborit (2020) address the code equivalence problem, emphasizing its cryptographic significance and its relation to the graph isomorphism problem. Their exploration of the hardness of decoding and equivalence problems complements our focus on the importance of invariants for distinguishing rank-metric codes (Couvreur et al., 2020).

The exploration of algebraic structures in rank-metric codes is further extended by Neri (2021), who introduces a skew polynomial ring approach for sum-rank metric codes. This generalization parallels our investigation into new algebraic structures, particularly in distinguishing different code families. The introduction of twisted linearized Reed-Solomon codes and the Trombetti-Zhou construction in the sum-rank metric offers new perspectives on maximum distance codes, aligning with our focus on novel geometric invariants (Neri, 2021). Alfarano et al. (2021) also contribute to this theme by exploring the tensor product of codes with Hamming and rank metrics, resulting in a code with the sum-rank metric. Their work on semilinear isometries and bounds in the sum-rank metric complements our investigation of algebraic structures and invariants, providing insights into differentiating specific code families (Alfarano et al., 2021).

The development of new criteria and constructions for rank-metric codes is another area of active research. Horlemann-Trautmann and Marshall (2015) introduce criteria for identifying maximum rank distance (MRD) codes and determining if they are generalized Gabidulin codes. Their work on constructing linear MRD codes that are not generalized Gabidulin codes complements our focus on differentiating Gabidulin codes from random ones through the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers (Horlemann-Trautmann & Marshall, 2015). Similarly, Ndiaye et al. (2023) explore the generalization of Subspace Subcodes in the rank metric, providing an algorithm for generating and characterizing these codes. Their emphasis on improving cryptographic security through subcodes aligns with our interest in post-quantum cryptography applications (Ndiaye et al., 2023).

The investigation of algebraic invariants and their applications in rank-metric coding theory is further enriched by the work of Ravagnani (2014), who explores generalized weights as algebraic invariants for codes. His introduction of ""Delsarte generalized weights"" for Delsarte rank-metric codes refines the generalized rank weights for Gabidulin codes, providing a framework for understanding algebraic invariants that aligns with our focus on novel geometric invariants (Ravagnani, 2014). Byrne and Ravagnani (2016) also contribute to this understanding by exploring properties and invariants of matrix codes with the rank metric, introducing tools like puncturing and shortening constructions. Their focus on maximal and quasi-maximal rank distance codes complements our investigation into geometric invariants, providing a broader context for understanding the distinctiveness of Gabidulin codes (Byrne & Ravagnani, 2016).

Finally, the geometric properties of rank-metric codes are explored by Ott et al. (2023), who provide a geometric characterization of sum-rank metric codes and investigate one-weight codes. Their examination of the relationship between sum-rank and Hamming metrics complements our work on using geometric perspectives to differentiate code families (Ott et al., 2023). Berardini and Caruso (2024) introduce linearized Reed-Muller codes in the sum-rank metric using multivariate Ore polynomials, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing code families. Their focus on embedding codes into linearized Algebraic Geometry codes complements our geometric perspective on vanishing ideals, highlighting a shared interest in leveraging algebraic structures for code differentiation and potential decoding applications (Berardini & Caruso, 2024). Together, these works provide a comprehensive understanding of the algebraic and geometric structures that underpin rank-metric codes, offering valuable insights into their classification and application.","Anna-Lena Horlemann-Trautmann, Kyle Marshall (2015).
