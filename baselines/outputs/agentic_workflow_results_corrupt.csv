"CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not
fall out of a tree",,"In recent years, the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in code generation have been extensively explored, with a focus on their ability to handle multiple programming languages and diverse coding tasks. A significant contribution in this area is the MultiPL-E benchmark, introduced by Cassano et al. (2022), which extends existing Python-based benchmarks to 18 additional programming languages. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to generalize across languages, providing a scalable and extensible framework for evaluating multi-language code generation. Similarly, Xue et al. (2024) propose the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), which leverages the multi-language capabilities of LLMs to enhance code generation performance by integrating outputs from different languages. Both studies underscore the importance of multi-language evaluation in understanding the full potential of LLMs in code generation.

Another critical aspect of LLMs in code generation is their ability to handle code constraints and domain-specific languages (DSLs). Kammakomati et al. (2024) address this by introducing ConCodeEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of code constraints in DSLs like JSON and YAML. Their findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in general code generation tasks, they struggle with maintaining code constraints, indicating a gap in their ability to handle more nuanced coding requirements. This aligns with the observations in our study, where we find that LLMs, despite generating semantically correct code, often fail to accurately trace execution paths, particularly in complex scenarios involving recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming.

The limitations of existing benchmarks in terms of linguistic and task diversity are further explored by Raihan et al. (2024) in their work on mHumanEval. This benchmark extends the HumanEval benchmark to support over 200 natural languages, addressing the gap in multilingual code generation evaluation. By providing expert human translations for diverse languages, mHumanEval offers insights into the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks. This is particularly relevant to our research, as it emphasizes the importance of diverse and robust benchmarks in accurately assessing the capabilities of LLMs in code-related tasks.

Our work builds upon these studies by introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which specifically targets the ability of LLMs to trace code execution paths, a critical aspect of code reasoning that is often overlooked in existing benchmarks. By focusing on advanced structural components such as recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming, we provide a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs' code reasoning abilities. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant strides in code generation, there is still a considerable gap in their ability to understand and navigate complex code structures. We hope that CoCoNUT will serve as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to bridge this gap and enhance the code reasoning capabilities of future LLMs.",large language models code generation,"['Federico Cassano, John Gouwar, Daniel Nguyen, Sydney Nguyen, Luna Phipps-Costin, Donald Pinckney, Ming-Ho Yee, Yangtian Zi, Carolyn Jane Anderson, Molly Q Feldman, Arjun Guha, Michael Greenberg, Abhinav Jangda (2022).

"Partially private, optimistic, distributed, and verifiable machine learning inference",,"The field of privacy-preserving machine learning has seen significant advancements, particularly in the context of federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP). Federated learning, as explored by Liu et al. (2023) [1], offers a collaborative framework that inherently preserves privacy by allowing clients to train models locally. Their work introduces binary neural networks and discrete noise to enhance communication efficiency and achieve client-level differential privacy. Similarly, Hayati et al. (2024) [8] propose a privacy-preserving FL framework that combines differential privacy with system immersion tools from control theory, aiming to balance privacy with model performance and system efficiency. These approaches highlight the ongoing efforts to mitigate privacy leakage in FL systems, which is a crucial consideration in distributed machine learning environments.

Differential privacy remains a cornerstone in privacy-preserving deep learning, as evidenced by the works of Lécuyer (2021) [4, 7] and Bu et al. (2019) [6]. Lécuyer focuses on the practical integration of Rényi Differential Privacy into deep learning frameworks, addressing the challenges of adaptive privacy budgets and composition theorems. Bu et al. leverage $f$-differential privacy to refine privacy analysis in neural network training, offering improved privacy guarantees without compromising prediction accuracy. These studies underscore the importance of differential privacy in ensuring robust privacy protection during model training, a theme that resonates with the privacy concerns addressed in our research.

The concept of privacy amplification through subsampling is another significant theme, as discussed by Schuchardt et al. (2024) [3]. Their framework provides mechanism-specific guarantees that enhance privacy accounting over multiple iterations, outperforming traditional mechanism-agnostic bounds. This approach is particularly relevant for privacy accounting in distributed systems, where privacy parameters must be carefully managed to prevent information leakage. Arora and Ré (2022) [5] further explore the potential of foundation models to achieve perfect secrecy, proposing in-context learning as a competitive baseline alongside FL. Their work challenges the notion of privacy-utility trade-offs, suggesting that emerging ML tools can offer stronger privacy guarantees without sacrificing model performance.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by addressing the less-explored area of model parameter privacy during inference. While existing studies primarily focus on input privacy and training phase privacy, our approach leverages zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) to enable partial privacy in distributed ML inference. By allowing model providers to selectively reveal model sections, we ensure verifiable and tamper-proof inference across trusted and untrusted nodes, fostering trust among participants. This novel application of zkSNARKs complements the privacy-preserving techniques discussed in related works, offering a scalable solution for ML edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned models. Our findings highlight the potential for future optimizations to extend support to larger models, contributing to the ongoing discourse on privacy in machine learning deployment.",privacy in machine learning models parameter privacy,"['Lumin Liu, Jun Zhang, Shenghui Song, Khaled B.

"SpikeDecoder: Realizing the GPT Architecture
with Spiking Neural Networks",,"The exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the realm of natural language processing (NLP). This section reviews relevant literature that aligns with the themes of energy efficiency and spike-driven language modeling, providing a foundation for the proposed SpikeDecoder model.

Recent advancements in spike-driven language modeling have been exemplified by the work of Xingrun Xing et al. (2024) in their development of SpikeLM, a fully spiking mechanism tailored for general language tasks. SpikeLM introduces an innovative approach to spike encoding, utilizing bi-directional, elastic amplitude, and frequency encoding to enhance semantic representation within SNNs. This method addresses the limitations of binary spikes in existing SNNs, which often struggle to capture adequate semantic information for generalization. By integrating this elastic bi-spiking mechanism, SpikeLM significantly narrows the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling tasks, demonstrating higher accuracy than previously achievable (Xing et al., 2024). This work underscores the potential of SNNs in handling complex language tasks, setting a precedent for further exploration in spike-driven NLP models.

Complementing the advancements in spike-driven language modeling, the study by R. Alexander Knipper et al. (2024) delves into the application of SNNs in NLP, specifically focusing on energy-efficient processing. Their research, titled SNNLP, investigates various methods of encoding text into spike trains, a critical step for seamless integration with SNN architectures. The authors propose a novel encoding technique that surpasses traditional Poisson rate-coding, achieving a 13% improvement in performance on benchmark NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. Moreover, SNNLP highlights the substantial energy efficiency gains of SNNs over conventional deep neural networks, with a reported increase of more than 32x during inference and 60x during training (Knipper et al., 2024). This study emphasizes the importance of efficient text encoding in realizing the full potential of SNNs for NLP applications, aligning closely with the objectives of the SpikeDecoder model.

The convergence of these studies illustrates a growing interest in leveraging the energy-efficient properties of SNNs for NLP tasks, a domain traditionally dominated by power-intensive ANN architectures. Both SpikeLM and SNNLP contribute valuable insights into spike encoding and model design, addressing key challenges in the adaptation of SNNs for language processing. These works provide a crucial backdrop for the development of SpikeDecoder, which seeks to extend the application of spike-based models to the Transformer architecture, specifically focusing on the decoder-only model for NLP.

In this context, the proposed SpikeDecoder model builds upon the foundational work of SpikeLM and SNNLP by introducing a fully spike-based version of the Transformer decoder. By systematically analyzing the impact of replacing ANN components with spike-based alternatives, SpikeDecoder aims to identify critical areas of performance loss and optimize energy efficiency. Additionally, the exploration of residual connections and spike-compatible normalization techniques further refines the model architecture. The formulation of novel embedding methods to project text data into spike-range complements the encoding strategies discussed in SNNLP, ensuring seamless integration with the spike-driven framework. Ultimately, SpikeDecoder demonstrates a significant reduction in theoretical energy consumption, advancing the field of energy-efficient NLP and paving the way for future innovations in spike-driven language models.",spiking neural networks natural language processing,"['Xingrun Xing, Zheng Zhang, Ziyi Ni, Shitao Xiao, Yiming Ju, Siqi Fan, Yequan Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Guoqi Li (2024).

"T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image
is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs",2411.19951,"The field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements, particularly in the realm of video understanding. A prominent theme in recent research is the development of large-scale datasets and pre-training strategies to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs. For instance, Lei et al. (2021) introduced VICTOR, a framework for video-language understanding that leverages contrastive multimodal pre-training on a large-scale Chinese video-language dataset. This approach addresses the challenges of capturing complex semantic and structural relationships in video data. Similarly, Wang et al. (2023) presented InternVid, a massive video-text dataset designed to facilitate the learning of transferable video-text representations. Their work underscores the importance of scalable data generation methods for improving video-language representation learning. Both studies highlight the critical role of comprehensive datasets in advancing MLLMs for video understanding.

Another significant area of research focuses on the evaluation and enhancement of MLLMs' visual perception capabilities. Wu et al. (2024) assessed the performance of various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, in understanding animal behavior through video data. Their findings reveal that while current models demonstrate initial visual perception capabilities, there is room for improvement in semantic correspondence and time perception. This aligns with the work of Zou et al. (2024), who reviewed the challenges of long video understanding, emphasizing the need for models to handle fine-grained spatiotemporal details and long-term dependencies. These studies collectively point to the ongoing efforts to refine MLLMs for more nuanced video understanding tasks.

In the context of model tuning and optimization, Ahn et al. (2024) explored the use of reinforcement learning from AI feedback to enhance video-text alignment in MLLMs. Their approach, VLM-RLAIF, demonstrates improved performance across various video benchmarks, highlighting the potential of self-supervised learning strategies. This is complemented by the work of Han et al. (2024), who provided a comprehensive tutorial on multimodal large models and instruction tuning strategies, offering insights into optimizing MLLMs for specific tasks. These contributions underscore the importance of innovative tuning methodologies in maximizing the performance of MLLMs.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by addressing the limitations identified in zero-shot inference and fine-tuning approaches for video understanding. We propose a novel data augmentation method, T2Vid, to synthesize video-like samples, thereby enriching the instruction diversity in the training corpus. This approach not only enhances learning efficiency but also achieves performance comparable to using full video datasets with significantly reduced sample sizes. By focusing on instruction diversity and efficient training schemes, our work aims to advance the application of MLLMs in video understanding, particularly in long video contexts, without the need for extensive video data.

Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners,2411.19865,"**Related Work**

The concept of reverse thinking in human reasoning has been explored in various domains, particularly in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence models. A significant contribution in this area is the work by Chen et al. (2024), who introduced the Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink) framework. This framework leverages reverse thinking to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating structured forward-backward reasoning. The authors demonstrated that by augmenting datasets with both forward and backward reasoning processes, LLMs could achieve substantial improvements in reasoning tasks across multiple domains, including commonsense, math, and logical reasoning. Their approach also highlighted the sample efficiency of reverse thinking, showing that even with limited data, models could outperform traditional fine-tuning methods (Chen et al., 2024).

In the broader context of reasoning enhancement in LLMs, several studies have focused on data augmentation and multi-task learning as key strategies. These methods aim to improve model generalization and performance by exposing models to diverse reasoning patterns. For instance, the work by Chen et al. aligns with previous research that emphasizes the importance of diverse training objectives and structured data augmentation in enhancing model capabilities. By integrating reverse thinking into the training process, these studies collectively underscore the potential of leveraging human-like reasoning patterns to boost AI performance.

Another relevant area of research is knowledge distillation, where a smaller student model is trained to mimic the performance of a larger teacher model. The RevThink framework by Chen et al. (2024) incorporates elements of knowledge distillation by using a teacher model to generate structured reasoning data, which is then used to train a student model. This approach not only improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model but also demonstrates the effectiveness of reverse thinking in achieving better performance compared to traditional knowledge distillation baselines.

In the context of my research, the introduction of the Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework builds upon these foundational studies by further refining the integration of reverse thinking into LLM training. My work extends the principles established by Chen et al. (2024) by introducing specific learning objectives tailored to reverse thinking, thereby enhancing the model's ability to perform consistency checks between forward and backward reasoning. The experimental results presented in my study corroborate the findings of previous research, demonstrating significant improvements in reasoning performance and sample efficiency. By contextualizing reverse thinking within a structured framework, my research contributes to the ongoing discourse on enhancing AI reasoning capabilities, offering a novel approach that leverages the bidirectional nature of human reasoning.",reverse thinking reasoning AI,"['Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zifeng Wang, Hamid Palangi, Rujun Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Long Le, Vincent Perot, Swaroop Mishra, Mohit Bansal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister (2024).

Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication,2411.19431,"In the realm of mediated communication and information design, several studies have explored the role of commitment power and the mechanisms that enhance communication efficacy. A prominent theme in this area is the use of money-burning tactics to improve mediated communication, as discussed in the paper by Yi Liu and Yang Yu (2024). Their research delves into the sender's ability to design a communication mechanism that incorporates both message transmission and money-burning, ultimately characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff. This approach is particularly relevant to our study, as it provides a foundational understanding of how money-burning can be strategically employed to enhance commitment power, thereby improving the sender's payoff across various prior beliefs (Liu & Yu, 2024).

Another significant contribution to the field is the work by Itai Arieli, Ivan Geffner, and Moshe Tennenholtz (2022) on mediated cheap talk design. This paper examines an information design problem involving two informed senders and a receiver, where the senders lack commitment power. The authors introduce a trusted mediator that gathers data and recommends actions to the receiver, characterizing the set of implementable action distributions in equilibrium. Their findings highlight the potential of mediation to optimize equilibrium outcomes for senders, offering insights into the design of communication mechanisms that can be leveraged in contexts where commitment power is absent (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022).

Further exploring the value of mediation, Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2023) investigate the benefits of a trusted mediator in long cheap talk scenarios. Their study extends the classic equilibrium model by Aumann and Hart, focusing on settings where a fully informed sender must disclose information to influence a self-interested receiver. The authors demonstrate that mediation can improve the payoff of external decision-makers and, in certain games, benefit both the sender and receiver simultaneously. This research underscores the potential of mediation to enhance communication outcomes, even in the absence of direct benefits to the primary communicating parties (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2023).

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by integrating the concept of money-burning into mediated communication models, specifically within the context of Web 3.0 communities. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff and linking it to robust Bayesian persuasion, we provide a novel perspective on the strategic use of money-burning tactics to enhance commitment power. Our findings demonstrate that, generically, these tactics can significantly improve the sender's payoff, offering practical applications for communication models in decentralized digital environments. This work not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of mediated communication but also offers actionable insights for designing effective communication mechanisms in emerging technological landscapes.",mediated communication commitment power,"['Yi Liu, Yang Yu (2024).

"Condorcet-Consistent Choice
Among Three Candidates",2411.19857,"The study of Condorcet extensions and their susceptibility to various paradoxes has been a significant area of research in social choice theory. A foundational work in this domain is by Brandt, Dong, and Peters (2024), who explore the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes specifically in the context of three-candidate elections. Their findings establish that the reinforcement paradox is inevitable for any Condorcet extension with at least eight voters, while certain refinements of the maximin rule are immune to this paradox with seven or fewer voters. Additionally, they identify that only homogeneous Condorcet extensions that are refinements of maximin are immune to the no-show paradox. This paper provides a critical backdrop for our research, as it highlights the vulnerabilities of Condorcet extensions and sets the stage for further exploration into the axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements, which are central to our study.

Another relevant contribution is by Peters (2017), who investigates the manipulability of Condorcet-consistent voting rules through preference reversals. Peters demonstrates that any Condorcet-consistent rule can be manipulated when there are at least four alternatives, correcting previous errors in the literature. This work underscores the inherent challenges in designing voting rules that are both Condorcet-consistent and resistant to strategic manipulation. While our research focuses on three-candidate elections, Peters' findings on preference reversals provide a broader context for understanding the limitations of Condorcet extensions and the importance of developing robust voting rules that can withstand strategic behavior.

The exploration of paradoxes in voting systems is further enriched by Baharav, Constantinescu, and Wattenhofer (2025), who examine Condorcet winners in the context of weighted binary voting and Ostrogorski's Paradox. Their work reveals the complexity of determining Condorcet-winning proposals and introduces efficient algorithms for specific voting conditions. Although their focus is on binary issues and weighted voting, the insights into paradoxes and computational challenges resonate with our investigation into the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in three-candidate elections. Their approach to handling paradoxes through computational methods complements our axiomatic characterizations, offering a different perspective on addressing the vulnerabilities of Condorcet extensions.

Holliday and Pacuit (2020) propose the Split Cycle method, a Condorcet-consistent voting rule that is independent of clones and immune to spoilers. This method addresses the spoiler effects and strong no-show paradoxes, providing a novel solution to some of the issues faced by traditional Condorcet extensions. While Split Cycle is not directly related to the specific paradoxes we examine, its innovative approach to mitigating voting rule vulnerabilities highlights the ongoing efforts to refine Condorcet extensions and improve their robustness. This work exemplifies the diversity of strategies employed to enhance the reliability of voting systems, which aligns with our goal of characterizing maximin and its refinements for three-candidate elections.

In summary, our research builds upon the existing literature by focusing on the specific case of three-candidate elections and providing axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements. By establishing the conditions under which these voting rules are immune to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes, we contribute to the broader discourse on designing Condorcet extensions that are both theoretically sound and practically viable.

Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,2411.18627,"In recent years, the integration of machine learning techniques into data assimilation frameworks has gained significant attention, as researchers seek to improve the accuracy and efficiency of predictions in complex dynamical systems. A notable contribution in this area is the work by Huang et al. (2024), who introduced DiffDA, a diffusion model for weather-scale data assimilation. This model leverages the capabilities of a pretrained GraphCast neural network to assimilate atmospheric variables, achieving high-resolution global atmospheric data consistent with observations. The approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning models to handle sparse observations and produce reliable forecasts, highlighting the growing trend of utilizing advanced neural networks in data assimilation tasks (Huang et al., 2024).

Similarly, Cheng et al. (2024) developed TorchDA, a Python package that integrates deep learning models within data assimilation workflows. This package supports various algorithms, including the Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, and allows for flexible algorithm selection based on specific application needs. TorchDA's ability to enhance performance in high-dimensional systems, such as the Lorenz 63 and shallow water systems, underscores the importance of combining deep learning with traditional data assimilation techniques to tackle complex physical systems (Cheng et al., 2024).

Addressing the challenge of simulator imperfection, Luo (2019) proposed an ensemble-based kernel learning approach for data assimilation problems. This method focuses on functional approximation to handle model errors, utilizing kernel-based learning to improve assimilation performance. By integrating ensemble-based learning into data assimilation frameworks, Luo's work provides a viable strategy for managing simulator imperfections, which is a common issue in practical applications. This approach aligns with the broader effort to enhance data assimilation through machine learning techniques, offering a pathway to address inherent model inaccuracies (Luo, 2019).

Building on these advancements, our research introduces a novel data assimilation algorithm grounded in topological data analysis. Unlike traditional methods that require knowledge of measurement noise statistics, our approach employs gradient descent optimization to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecasts. By focusing on the differentiability of functions of persistence, we offer a unique solution that does not rely on noise information, thereby broadening the applicability of data-driven models in dynamic systems. Our method's application to the chaotic Lorenz system exemplifies its potential to improve prediction accuracy without the constraints of noise statistics, contributing to the evolving landscape of data assimilation research.",data-driven models data assimilation,"['Langwen Huang, Lukas Gianinazzi, Yuejiang Yu, Peter D.

(2021) delve into the intricacies of status update systems using Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHSs), where the transition dynamics are polynomial functions of AoI. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of age processes and their stability, providing a framework for optimizing average age through sequential convex approximation methods. Their work highlights the importance of considering age-dependent dynamics in system design, which is relevant to our exploration of parallel and series server setups where processing speed impacts AoI and power consumption (Maatouk, Assaad, & Ephremides, 2021).

Another line of research by Bastopcu and Ulukus (2019) examines the trade-off between update quality and AoI in systems where updates are subject to distortion constraints. They model the quality of updates as a function of processing time, with longer processing times yielding lower distortion but higher AoI. Their work identifies age-optimal policies for update request and processing times, considering both constant and age-dependent distortion constraints. This exploration of quality versus age trade-offs is pertinent to our study, as we address the age-power trade-off in systems with sequential processing steps, where faster processing can reduce age but increase power consumption (Bastopcu & Ulukus, 2019).

In a related study, Bastopcu and Ulukus (2019) further investigate the impact of distortion on AoI, focusing on the update generation process at the transmitter. They propose policies to optimize AoI while maintaining a minimum required quality of updates, emphasizing the balance between processing time and update quality. This research underscores the complexity of managing AoI in systems with multiple constraints, aligning with our analysis of wasted power in parallel and series server setups, where processing efforts may not always lead to age reduction (Bastopcu & Ulukus, 2019).

Our work builds on these foundational studies by modeling and analyzing AoI performance in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. We extend the understanding of AoI dynamics by identifying scenarios where processing efforts result in wasted power, particularly in parallel and series server setups. By formulating an optimization problem to determine optimal service rates under a power budget, we address the age-power trade-off, offering insights into efficient system design. Our focus on systems with two computational steps provides a practical framework for optimizing AoI while managing power consumption, contributing to the broader discourse on AoI optimization in complex systems.",Age of Information in computational systems,"['Ali Maatouk, Mohamad Assaad, Anthony Ephremides (2021).

A GEOMETRIC INVARIANT OF LINEAR RANK-METRIC CODES,2411.19087,"The study of rank-metric codes has been a significant area of research within the broader field of coding theory, with numerous applications in network coding, distributed storage, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent advancements in channel coding have explored various innovative approaches to enhance error-correcting capabilities. Arikan et al. (2015) provide a comprehensive survey of ongoing research in channel coding, focusing on spatially coupled Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, non-binary LDPC codes, and polar coding. These developments highlight the importance of exploring new algebraic structures and invariants in coding theory, which aligns with the objectives of our research in developing novel geometric invariants for rank-metric codes [1].

Parallel to these advancements, the integration of deep learning techniques into channel coding has opened new avenues for code design and decoding. Matsumine and Ochiai (2024) review the application of deep learning in channel coding, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize error-correcting codes such as LDPC and polar codes. Their work categorizes various deep learning approaches, including model-free and model-based techniques, which offer promising directions for enhancing the performance of modern error-correcting codes [2]. This exploration of innovative methodologies in channel coding underscores the necessity of developing new tools and invariants, such as the geometric invariant proposed in our study, to further distinguish and optimize rank-metric codes.

The intersection of these research areas—channel coding innovations and deep learning applications—demonstrates a growing interest in leveraging advanced mathematical and computational techniques to address challenges in coding theory. Both Arikan et al. (2015) and Matsumine and Ochiai (2024) highlight the need for novel approaches to code design and error correction, which resonates with our focus on the geometric perspective of rank-metric codes and the introduction of a Schur product-inspired invariant [1][2]. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers, our work contributes to this evolving landscape by providing a new method to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones, thereby enhancing the understanding and application of rank-metric codes.

In conclusion, our research builds upon the foundational work in channel coding and the emerging trends in deep learning applications to propose a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes. This approach not only offers a new tool for distinguishing specific code families but also enriches the theoretical framework of rank-metric codes by integrating geometric and algebraic insights. By addressing the challenges identified in recent literature, our study aims to advance the field of coding theory and contribute to the development of more robust and efficient error-correcting codes for practical applications.",rank-metric codes recent research,"['Erdal Arikan, Najeeb ul Hassan, Michael Lentmaier, Guido Montorsi, Jossy Sayir (2015).
