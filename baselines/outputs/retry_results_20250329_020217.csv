Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication,2411.19431,"In the realm of Bayesian persuasion, the commitment power of senders plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics and outcomes of strategic communication games. The paper by Su and Subramanian (2022) delves into the intricacies of commitment order in Bayesian persuasion scenarios involving multiple senders. Their research highlights the impact of sequential signaling and commitment on equilibrium payoffs, particularly when senders possess partial information about the state of the world. This study provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which different commitment orders lead to distinct payoff profiles, emphasizing the collaborative potential of senders and the strategic use of credible threats. This exploration of commitment order is relevant to our work, as it underscores the importance of strategic commitment in enhancing sender payoffs, a theme central to our investigation of money-burning tactics for commitment power (Su & Subramanian, 2022).

Arieli, Babichenko, and Sandomirskiy (2022) extend the discussion of Bayesian persuasion by introducing mediators into the communication process. Their work characterizes the sender's optimal value across varying numbers of mediators, revealing that while a single mediator does not benefit the sender, the presence of a second mediator can enhance the sender's value. This geometric interpretation of constrained concavification aligns with our approach of using geometric insights to characterize sender payoffs. The notion of mediators, although distinct from our focus on money-burning, parallels our exploration of mechanisms that can alter sender-receiver dynamics, offering a complementary perspective on enhancing sender utility through strategic design (Arieli, Babichenko, & Sandomirskiy, 2022).

The concept of multi-channel communication, as explored by Babichenko et al. (2021), introduces a nuanced perspective on information dissemination in Bayesian persuasion. Their model bridges the gap between private and public persuasion by considering receivers who observe subsets of the sender's communication channels. This framework provides a comprehensive characterization of communication structures that optimize sender utility, based on information dominance among receivers. While our research does not directly address multi-channel communication, the underlying principle of optimizing sender utility through strategic communication design resonates with our investigation into money-burning tactics. The computational challenges identified in their work further highlight the complexity of designing optimal communication mechanisms, a challenge we address through our model's geometric interpretations (Babichenko et al., 2021).

Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2022) explore mediated cheap talk design, focusing on scenarios where senders lack commitment power. Their study introduces a trusted mediator who gathers data and recommends actions to the receiver, characterizing the set of implementable action distributions in equilibrium. This approach contrasts with traditional Bayesian persuasion settings, offering insights into alternative mechanisms for influencing receiver actions. While our research emphasizes the role of commitment power through money-burning, the concept of mediated communication provides a broader context for understanding how strategic mechanisms can shape sender-receiver interactions. The algorithmic solutions proposed in their work also highlight the potential for computational approaches to optimize communication strategies, a theme relevant to our geometric characterization of sender payoffs (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022).

In summary, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on strategic communication in Bayesian persuasion by introducing money-burning tactics as a novel mechanism for enhancing commitment power. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff through geometric interpretations, we offer a unique perspective that complements existing studies on commitment order, mediator influence, and multi-channel communication. Our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities further contextualizes the commitment value within contemporary digital environments, providing a practical framework for understanding and leveraging strategic communication in decentralized settings.","mediated communication, money-burning tactics, commitment power, Bayesian persuasion, Web 3.0 communities","['Shih-Tang Su, Vijay G.
