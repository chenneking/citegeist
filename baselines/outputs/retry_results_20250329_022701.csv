"Condorcet-Consistent Choice
Among Three Candidates",2411.19857,"In the realm of social choice theory, the study of Condorcet extensions and their susceptibility to paradoxes has been a focal point of research. Several works have explored various aspects of Condorcet-consistent voting rules, providing insights into their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications. A significant contribution to this field is the exploration of distance rationalizability, as discussed by Elkind, Faliszewski, and Slinko (2010). Their work investigates the rationalization of Condorcet-consistent rules using distances akin to the Hamming distance, offering a novel perspective on how these rules can be conceptualized. This approach is particularly relevant to our study, as it highlights the complexity and computational challenges associated with Condorcet extensions, which are central to understanding their susceptibility to paradoxes.

Another pertinent area of research is the computational complexity of Condorcet-consistent voting rules, as examined by Schlotter and Cechlárová (2025). Their analysis of the Possible President problem provides a comprehensive view of the computational challenges faced by various Condorcet-consistent rules, including Maximin. By classifying cases based on the number of voters and other parameters, they delineate the boundaries of tractability for these problems. This work complements our investigation by underscoring the computational aspects of Condorcet extensions, particularly in the context of three-candidate elections, where paradoxes such as the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes are prevalent.

The manipulation of Condorcet-consistent voting rules is another critical theme explored in the literature. Peters (2017) addresses the preference reversal paradox, demonstrating the vulnerability of these rules to strategic manipulation by voters. This study is instrumental in understanding the broader implications of Condorcet extensions, as it reveals inherent weaknesses that can be exploited under certain conditions. Our research builds on this foundation by examining specific paradoxes that arise in three-candidate scenarios, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations and potential refinements of Condorcet extensions.

The Maximin rule, a central focus of our paper, has been extended to various voting contexts, as illustrated by Sánchez-Fernández et al. (2016). Their work on the maximin support method extends the D'Hondt apportionment method to approval-based multiwinner elections, showcasing the versatility and applicability of maximin principles. This extension is particularly relevant to our study, as it highlights the adaptability of maximin refinements in addressing paradoxes within Condorcet extensions. By demonstrating the immunity of certain maximin refinements to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes, our research aligns with the broader discourse on enhancing the robustness of voting rules.

In summary, our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on Condorcet extensions by providing a focused analysis of their susceptibility to paradoxes in three-candidate elections. By establishing the conditions under which these paradoxes occur and identifying refinements of maximin that are immune to them, we offer a novel perspective on the suitability of these voting rules. Our axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements further enrich the theoretical landscape, paving the way for future research on the refinement and application of Condorcet-consistent rules in diverse electoral contexts.",Condorcet extensions voting paradoxes maximin Nanson,"[""Luis Sánchez-Fernández, Norberto Fernández, Jesús A.
