"CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not
fall out of a tree",,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the field of code generation, with various studies exploring their capabilities across multiple programming languages and benchmarks. A prominent theme in recent research is the extension of code generation benchmarks to encompass a broader range of programming languages, as seen in the work by Cassano et al. (2022) and Raihan et al. (2024). Cassano et al. introduced MultiPL-E, a scalable system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages, thereby creating a multilingual benchmark that evaluates models like Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder across 18 languages. Similarly, Raihan et al. expanded the HumanEval benchmark to support prompts in over 200 natural languages, addressing limitations in task diversity and linguistic scope. These efforts highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in diverse linguistic contexts, which is crucial for understanding their generalization capabilities across different programming paradigms.

Another significant area of research focuses on leveraging the multi-language capabilities of LLMs to enhance code generation performance. Xue et al. (2024) proposed the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), an ensemble-based method that integrates code generation outputs from multiple programming languages to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. By treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert,"" MPLE enhances overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like HumanEval. This approach underscores the potential of multi-language strategies in improving the robustness and accuracy of code generation models, suggesting that integrating diverse linguistic outputs can lead to more reliable code generation.

In addition to language diversity, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code constraints in domain-specific languages is another critical aspect of code generation research. Kammakomati et al. (2024) introduced ConCodeEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of code constraints in DSLs like JSON and YAML. Their findings indicate that while LLMs perform well in general code tasks, they struggle with fine-grained constraints, highlighting a gap in current models' controllability over code constraints. This research emphasizes the need for benchmarks that assess not only the syntactic correctness of generated code but also its adherence to specific constraints, which is essential for system-level programming tasks.

Our work builds upon these themes by introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which evaluates LLMs' ability to trace the execution path of code, including advanced structural components like recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. While existing benchmarks like HumanEval focus on code generation accuracy, our research reveals that LLMs, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, possess limited capabilities in tracing execution paths, particularly for complex structures. By addressing this gap, our work provides a novel perspective on code reasoning abilities, emphasizing the need for models to improve their understanding of code control flow. We hope that CoCoNUT will serve as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to enhance the code reasoning capabilities of LLMs, bridging the gap between code generation and execution path comprehension.",large language models code generation,"['Federico Cassano, John Gouwar, Daniel Nguyen, Sydney Nguyen, Luna Phipps-Costin, Donald Pinckney, Ming-Ho Yee, Yangtian Zi, Carolyn Jane Anderson, Molly Q Feldman, Arjun Guha, Michael Greenberg, Abhinav Jangda (2022).

"Partially private, optimistic, distributed, and verifiable machine learning inference",,"The intersection of machine learning (ML) and privacy has garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of ensuring the confidentiality of model parameters and inputs during inference. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by South et al. (2024), which explores the use of zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) for verifiable evaluations of ML models. Their approach allows for the creation of zero-knowledge computational proofs that verify model outputs over datasets, thereby enabling end-users to trust the performance and fairness metrics of models with private weights without needing to access the model itself. This work highlights the potential of zkSNARKs in enhancing transparency and trust in ML model evaluations, setting a precedent for further exploration in this area (South et al., 2024).

In parallel, the broader field of privacy-preserving ML has seen various approaches aimed at safeguarding model parameters during inference. Techniques such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation have been extensively studied to ensure that model parameters remain confidential while still allowing for accurate inference. These methods, however, often come with significant computational overhead, which can limit their practicality in real-world applications. The work of South et al. (2024) and others in the field underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing privacy with computational efficiency, a theme that is central to the development of practical privacy-preserving ML solutions.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by addressing the specific challenge of partial privacy in distributed ML inference. While previous studies have primarily focused on the privacy of model inputs or the complete confidentiality of model parameters, our approach leverages zkSNARKs to enable selective disclosure of model sections. This allows model providers to maintain control over which parts of the model are revealed, facilitating verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a network of trusted and untrusted nodes. By doing so, we extend the application of zkSNARKs beyond verifiable evaluations to encompass the broader context of distributed ML inference, offering a novel solution that enhances trust among all participants in the inference process.

In conclusion, our work contributes to the evolving landscape of privacy-preserving ML by introducing a method that balances the need for privacy with the practical requirements of distributed inference. By demonstrating the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation and performance evaluation, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at optimizing and scaling this solution for larger models. Our findings suggest promising applications in areas such as ML edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned models, highlighting the potential for zkSNARKs to play a pivotal role in the next generation of privacy-preserving ML technologies.",privacy in machine learning inference using zkSNARKs,"[""Tobin South, Alexander Camuto, Shrey Jain, Shayla Nguyen, Robert Mahari, Christian Paquin, Jason Morton, Alex 'Sandy' Pentland (2024).

"SpikeDecoder: Realizing the GPT Architecture
with Spiking Neural Networks",,"The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP) due to its state-of-the-art performance. However, its high energy consumption remains a significant challenge, prompting research into more energy-efficient alternatives. A notable contribution in this area is the work by Cao et al. (2021), who introduced IrEne, an interpretable energy prediction system for Transformer-based NLP models. IrEne accurately predicts the inference energy consumption by breaking down models into modules and further into low-level machine learning primitives, achieving an error margin of under 7% compared to the ground truth. This work highlights the importance of understanding energy consumption at a granular level, which is crucial for developing energy-efficient models like the proposed SpikeDecoder in our research.

In parallel, Li et al. (2022) explored the energy consumption scaling laws of deep learning models through a Transistor Operations (TOs) method. Their approach translates neural network structures into arithmetic logic unit (ALU) tasks, providing a precise prediction of energy consumption across different hardware configurations. This work underscores the complexity of energy consumption in deep learning models and the need for innovative methods to accurately predict and reduce it. Our research aligns with this by proposing a spike-based model that inherently reduces energy consumption through its event-driven processing, offering a practical solution to the issues identified by Li et al.

The co-design of machine learning models and hardware accelerators has also been a focus of recent research, as demonstrated by Tuli and Jha (2023) with their TransCODE framework. This work emphasizes the need for efficient deployment of Transformer models on resource-constrained hardware by optimizing both model architecture and hardware design. Similarly, Xu et al. (2024) proposed SAMT, a framework for optimizing dataflow mapping of Transformer workloads onto spatial accelerators, achieving significant reductions in inference latency and energy consumption. These studies highlight the potential of hardware-software co-design in enhancing the efficiency of Transformer models, a concept that complements our approach of integrating spiking neural networks to achieve energy efficiency.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by introducing SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder model tailored for NLP applications. While previous efforts have focused on energy prediction and hardware optimization, our work directly addresses the training challenges of spiking neural networks and their integration into Transformer architectures. By analyzing the impact of replacing ANN components with spike-based alternatives and exploring spike-compatible normalization techniques, we aim to identify and mitigate performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, our investigation into embedding methods for projecting text data into spike-range represents a novel contribution to the field, demonstrating a significant reduction in theoretical energy consumption compared to traditional models. This positions our work as a pioneering effort in the development of energy-efficient NLP models using spiking neural networks.",Transformer architecture energy consumption,"['Qingqing Cao, Yash Kumar Lal, Harsh Trivedi, Aruna Balasubramanian, Niranjan Balasubramanian (2021).

"T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image
is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs",2411.19951,"The field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements, particularly in the realm of video understanding. A notable contribution in this area is the work by Lei et al. (2021), which introduces VICTOR, a framework for video-language understanding through contrastive multimodal pre-training. This approach addresses the challenges of capturing complex semantic and structural relationships in video-language data, particularly in the context of Chinese datasets. The emphasis on contrastive learning to enhance model robustness and capture multimodal relationships aligns with the broader trend of leveraging pre-trained models for improved video understanding, as explored in our study [1].

Similarly, the development of large-scale datasets like InternVid, as presented by Wang et al. (2023), underscores the importance of comprehensive video-text datasets for advancing multimodal understanding and generation. InternVid's extensive dataset facilitates the learning of transferable video-text representations, which are crucial for tasks such as zero-shot action recognition and video retrieval. This aligns with our approach of utilizing pre-trained image-LLMs and fine-tuning them with enriched video data to enhance video understanding capabilities [3].

In the context of model tuning and optimization, Ahn et al. (2024) propose a novel alignment strategy using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) to improve video-text multimodal alignment. This method highlights the challenges of aligning video and text modalities due to the limited volume and quality of multimodal instruction-tune data. Our work similarly addresses the issue of instruction diversity in video data, proposing the T2Vid method to synthesize video-like samples, thereby enriching the training corpus and improving learning efficiency [7].

The exploration of MLLMs in specific domains, such as animal behavior understanding, is exemplified by Wu et al. (2024), who evaluate the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs in recognizing piglet activities. This study highlights the potential of MLLMs in specialized video understanding tasks, despite current limitations in semantic correspondence and time perception. Our research contributes to this discourse by identifying limitations in zero-shot inference, such as limited generalization and temporal understanding, and proposing solutions to enhance MLLM performance in video understanding [2].

Our work builds upon these foundational studies by addressing the limitations of existing approaches in video understanding. By developing the T2Vid method, we aim to overcome the challenges of limited instruction diversity and low learning efficiency in fine-tuning MLLMs with video data. Our findings demonstrate that a strategic integration of synthesized video-like samples can achieve performance comparable to full video datasets, even with a reduced sample size. This not only enhances the efficiency of training schemes but also improves long video understanding without the need for extensive long video samples. We hope our study will inspire further exploration of MLLMs for video understanding and the development of high-quality data curation methods.",Multimodal Large Language Models video understanding,"['Chenyi Lei, Shixian Luo, Yong Liu, Wanggui He, Jiamang Wang, Guoxin Wang, Haihong Tang, Chunyan Miao, Houqiang Li (2021).

Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners,2411.19865,"In recent years, the exploration of reverse thinking in machine learning and artificial intelligence has gained significant attention, as researchers seek to enhance the cognitive capabilities of AI systems. Li and Wen (2018) delve into the concept of reverse thinking by addressing the limitations of inertial thinking in machine learning. They propose a method that leverages reverse thinking to correct errors arising from illusion inertial thinking, thereby improving the generalization ability of machine learning models. This approach aligns with the objectives of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework, which also seeks to incorporate reverse reasoning to bolster the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The theme of fostering higher-order thinking skills in AI systems is further explored by Yatani et al. (2024) through the concept of extraheric AI. Their framework emphasizes the importance of maintaining human cognitive engagement by encouraging creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving during human-AI interactions. This is achieved by posing questions and offering alternative perspectives rather than providing direct answers. The extraheric AI framework shares a conceptual similarity with REVTHINK, as both approaches aim to enhance cognitive processes—albeit through different mechanisms. While extraheric AI focuses on human-AI interaction, REVTHINK enhances the internal reasoning capabilities of AI models by integrating forward and backward reasoning.

Drosos et al. (2025) contribute to the discourse on critical thinking in AI-assisted environments by investigating the role of provocations in restoring critical thinking during knowledge work. Their study demonstrates that brief textual prompts can induce critical and metacognitive thinking, highlighting the importance of design interventions in AI systems to promote cognitive engagement. This research complements the goals of REVTHINK, as both approaches seek to mitigate the risk of cognitive complacency in AI systems. By incorporating reverse reasoning, REVTHINK aims to ensure that LLMs maintain a robust reasoning process, akin to the critical thinking provoked by the interventions studied by Drosos et al.

In summary, the existing body of work underscores the importance of integrating reverse thinking and fostering cognitive engagement in AI systems. Our REVTHINK framework builds upon these foundational ideas by introducing a structured approach to reverse reasoning in LLMs. By augmenting datasets with forward-backward reasoning and employing multi-task learning objectives, REVTHINK not only enhances reasoning performance but also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. This positions REVTHINK as a significant advancement in the field, offering a novel method to improve the cognitive robustness of AI models through reverse thinking.",reverse thinking in AI,"['Li Huihui, Wen Guihua (2018).

Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication,2411.19431,"In recent years, the exploration of mediated communication and its enhancement through various mechanisms has garnered significant attention in the field of information design. A notable contribution to this area is the work by Liu and Yu (2024), who investigate the role of money-burning tactics in improving mediated communication. Their study presents a model where the sender, possessing state-independent preferences, can design a communication mechanism that not only transmits messages but also incorporates money-burning as a commitment device. This approach is shown to enhance the sender's equilibrium payoff, particularly in scenarios where commitment is crucial. The geometric interpretations and connections to robust Bayesian persuasion outlined in their work provide a foundational understanding that directly informs the theoretical framework of our research (Liu & Yu, 2024).

Complementing this perspective, Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2022) delve into the design of mediated cheap talk mechanisms, focusing on scenarios with multiple informed senders and a receiver. Their research highlights the absence of commitment power in traditional Bayesian persuasion settings and introduces a trusted mediator to facilitate communication. By characterizing the set of implementable action distributions and developing an efficient algorithm to compute optimal equilibria, their work underscores the potential of mediation to enhance communication outcomes. This study provides a contrasting yet relevant backdrop to our exploration of money-burning tactics, as it emphasizes the role of mediation in environments lacking commitment power (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022).

Further expanding on the theme of mediation, Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2023) examine the value of mediation in long cheap talk scenarios. Their research investigates how a trusted mediator can influence the dynamics between a fully informed sender and a self-interested receiver. While the mediator may not directly benefit the sender or receiver in binary action settings, the study reveals that mediation can enhance the payoff of an external decision-maker. Additionally, in more complex action spaces, both the sender and receiver can simultaneously gain from mediation. This work highlights the nuanced benefits of mediation, offering insights into how external mechanisms can alter communication dynamics, which parallels the commitment-enhancing effects of money-burning in our model (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2023).

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by integrating the concept of money-burning into the mediated communication framework, specifically within the context of Web 3.0 communities. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff and demonstrating the strategic value of money-burning, our work extends the understanding of commitment mechanisms in communication models. The insights gained from Liu and Yu's exploration of money-burning, combined with the mediation strategies discussed by Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz, provide a comprehensive backdrop for our study. Ultimately, our research contributes to the broader discourse on enhancing communication through innovative mechanisms, offering practical implications for digital communities where commitment and trust are paramount.",mediated communication commitment power,"['Yi Liu, Yang Yu (2024).

"Condorcet-Consistent Choice
Among Three Candidates",2411.19857,"The study of Condorcet extensions and their susceptibility to various paradoxes has been a significant area of research in social choice theory. Several works have explored the intricacies of Condorcet-consistent voting rules, particularly focusing on paradoxes such as the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes. Brandt, Dong, and Peters (2024) delve into the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes specifically for three-candidate elections. They establish that the reinforcement paradox is inevitable for any Condorcet extension with at least eight voters, while certain refinements of the maximin rule are immune to this paradox with seven or fewer voters. Their work also highlights that only homogeneous Condorcet extensions that are refinements of maximin are immune to the no-show paradox, providing axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, which are particularly suitable for three-candidate elections (Brandt et al., 2024).

Dominik Peters (2017) addresses another dimension of Condorcet-consistent voting rules by examining their vulnerability to manipulation through preference reversal. Peters proves that any Condorcet-consistent rule can be manipulated by a voter reversing their preference ranking when there are at least four alternatives. This work corrects previous errors and enhances the understanding of strategy-proofness in voting rules, offering a strong form of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem. While Peters' focus is on preference reversal, it complements the exploration of paradoxes in Condorcet extensions by highlighting the broader challenges in ensuring fairness and robustness in voting systems (Peters, 2017).

The exploration of paradoxes extends to weighted binary voting scenarios, as investigated by Baharav, Constantinescu, and Wattenhofer (2025). Their research examines Ostrogorski's and Anscombe's paradoxes in the context of weighted voting, demonstrating the complexity of determining Condorcet-winning proposals and the computational challenges involved. They propose solutions to mitigate these paradoxes under specific conditions, such as identical weighting vectors, and extend Wagner's rule to the weighted setting. This work underscores the importance of considering voter weight and issue importance in the design of voting systems, which is relevant to understanding the limitations and potential refinements of Condorcet extensions (Baharav et al., 2025).

In contrast, Holliday and Pacuit (2020) introduce the Split Cycle method, a Condorcet-consistent voting method that addresses issues related to clone independence and spoiler effects. Split Cycle is unique in its ability to satisfy criteria such as immunity to spoilers and positive and negative involvement, which concern the addition of candidates and voters to elections. This method offers a novel approach to mitigating strong no-show paradoxes and spoiler effects, providing insights into alternative strategies for enhancing the robustness of Condorcet extensions (Holliday & Pacuit, 2020).

In the context of these studies, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse by focusing specifically on the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in three-candidate elections. By establishing the conditions under which these paradoxes occur and identifying refinements of maximin that are immune to them, our work provides a nuanced understanding of the limitations and potential improvements in Condorcet extensions. The axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements further enrich the theoretical framework for evaluating voting rules, offering practical insights for designing systems that are both fair and resistant to paradoxical outcomes.",Condorcet extensions voting paradoxes,"['Felix Brandt, Chris Dong, Dominik Peters (2024).

Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,2411.18627,"In recent years, the integration of machine learning techniques with data assimilation has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the predictive capabilities of models for dynamical systems. This trend is largely driven by the limitations of high-fidelity physics-based models, which often struggle to accurately capture complex system dynamics. The work by Georg A. Gottwald and Sebastian Reich (2020) exemplifies this approach by combining machine learning algorithms with data assimilation to improve forecast horizons for chaotic systems. Their method utilizes random feature maps within an ensemble Kalman filter framework, allowing for sequential learning from noisy observations. This integration not only enhances forecast skill but also facilitates probabilistic forecasting and model closure in multi-scale systems (Gottwald & Reich, 2020).

Another significant contribution to the field is the work by Xiaodong Luo (2019), which addresses the challenge of simulator imperfection in data assimilation. Luo proposes an ensemble-based kernel learning framework that leverages functional approximation to handle model errors. By identifying similarities between supervised learning and variational data assimilation, Luo develops a strategy to integrate ensemble-based learning into data assimilation processes. This approach effectively tackles issues such as multi-modality and improves assimilation performance, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to account for simulator imperfections (Luo, 2019).

The use of topological data analysis in data assimilation represents a novel direction in this research area. Max M. Chumley and Firas A. Khasawneh (2024) introduce a data assimilation algorithm grounded in topological data analysis, which minimizes topological differences between measurements and predictions without relying on noise statistics. Their method employs gradient descent optimization to tune model coefficients, showcasing the utility of topological approaches in enhancing data-driven models. This work aligns closely with the themes of leveraging machine learning and data assimilation to overcome the limitations of traditional models, as seen in the aforementioned studies (Chumley & Khasawneh, 2024).

In the context of these advancements, our research contributes to the growing body of work that seeks to refine data assimilation techniques through innovative methodologies. By introducing a topological data analysis-based algorithm, we aim to address the challenge of unknown measurement noise statistics, a common issue in classical data assimilation. Our approach not only builds on the foundational ideas presented by Chumley and Khasawneh but also extends the application of topological methods to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions in chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz system. This work underscores the potential of topological data analysis to enhance machine learning models in the realm of dynamical systems, offering a new perspective on data assimilation without the need for explicit noise information.",data assimilation algorithms machine learning topological data analysis,"['Max M.

"Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update
Processing",2411.19854v1,"The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various networked systems. Several studies have explored different aspects of AoI, particularly in systems involving multiple servers and queues. A significant body of work has focused on analyzing AoI in tandem and series server setups. For instance, Sinha et al. (2024) investigate the peak AoI in a system where updates traverse through a series of queues in tandem, each with distinct service rates. Their work provides a recursive framework to evaluate AoI under both preemptive and non-preemptive policies, highlighting the impact of server configurations on information freshness [1]. Similarly, Yates (2018) examines AoI in a network of preemptive servers, where updates follow a sequential path through network nodes. This study emphasizes how AoI accumulates across nodes, offering insights into the dynamics of information age in series server setups [2].

Parallel to these studies, research has also delved into optimizing server operations to manage AoI effectively. Vaze and Nair (2019) explore speed scaling in tandem server settings, where servers can adjust their processing speeds to balance power consumption and job processing efficiency. Their work introduces an online speed scaling algorithm that remains competitive with optimal offline solutions, demonstrating the potential of dynamic server management in reducing AoI [3]. Bhati et al. (2021) extend this line of inquiry by considering heterogeneous servers, where each server operates independently with its queue. They derive expressions for average AoI and propose strategies for optimal server utilization, showing that adding more servers can significantly reduce AoI [4].

These studies collectively underscore the importance of server configuration and management in optimizing AoI. They provide foundational insights into how different server setups—whether in series or parallel—affect the timeliness of information. However, while these works address various aspects of AoI, they often overlook the power consumption implications of different server configurations. This gap is particularly relevant in systems where processing speed and power usage are closely linked.

Our research builds on these foundational studies by explicitly addressing the age-power trade-off in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. We extend the analysis of AoI in both parallel and series server setups by identifying scenarios where processing efforts do not translate into reduced AoI, leading to wasted power. By formulating an optimization problem, we determine the optimal service rates for each processing step under a given power budget, focusing on a special case with two computational steps. This work not only contributes to the existing literature by integrating power considerations into AoI analysis but also provides practical guidelines for designing energy-efficient systems that maintain information freshness.",Age of Information parallel series server setups,"['Ashirwad Sinha, Shubhransh Singhvi, Praful D.

A GEOMETRIC INVARIANT OF LINEAR RANK-METRIC CODES,2411.19087,"The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research due to their applicability in various domains such as network coding, distributed storage, and post-quantum cryptography. A significant body of work has focused on enhancing the resilience of these codes against errors, particularly in distributed storage systems. Liu et al. (2018) [1] and Kadhe et al. (2017) [8] explore the concept of locality in error correction, which is crucial for efficient data recovery in distributed systems. Liu et al. introduce cover-metric codes with locality to address crisscross errors, while Kadhe et al. extend the notion of locality to rank and subspace metrics, proposing array codes that can recover from crisscross errors and erasures. These studies highlight the importance of designing codes that can efficiently handle correlated errors, a theme that resonates with the practical applications of rank-metric codes.

Another critical aspect of rank-metric codes is their role in secure communication and storage. Martínez-Peñas (2017) [3] investigates universal secure rank-metric coding schemes that minimize communication overheads in the presence of wire-tappers. This work demonstrates how Gabidulin codes can be transformed to achieve optimal information rates and security, emphasizing the versatility of rank-metric codes in secure network coding. Similarly, Martínez-Peñas (2022) [10] introduces the multi-cover metric to address multilayer crisscross errors, providing constructions and decoding algorithms for maximum multi-cover distance codes. These contributions underscore the ongoing efforts to enhance the security and efficiency of rank-metric codes in adversarial environments.

The exploration of algebraic structures and invariants in rank-metric codes is another area of active research. Astore et al. (2024) [2] introduce a novel geometric invariant inspired by the Schur product, which aids in distinguishing Gabidulin codes from random ones. This approach aligns with the broader research trend of developing new families of rank-metric codes with unique algebraic properties, as seen in the work of Martínez-Peñas (2017) [3] and others. The focus on invariants is crucial for understanding the fundamental properties of these codes and for constructing codes with desired characteristics.

In the context of distributed storage, regenerating codes have been extensively studied for their ability to maintain optimal bandwidth and storage efficiency. Li et al. (2015) [5, 7] propose Hermitian code-based regenerating codes that achieve theoretical bounds for storage and bandwidth while offering enhanced error correction capabilities in hostile networks. These works highlight the ongoing efforts to push the boundaries of regenerating codes beyond traditional limits, ensuring robust performance in challenging environments.

In summary, the existing literature on rank-metric codes covers a wide range of themes, from error correction and secure communication to algebraic invariants and regenerating codes. My research contributes to this rich tapestry by introducing a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product. This invariant provides a new tool for distinguishing between different families of rank-metric codes, offering insights into their algebraic structures and potential applications. By examining the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code, my work bridges the gap between algebraic theory and practical applications, paving the way for future advancements in the field.",rank-metric codes applications network coding distributed storage crisscross error correction post-quantum cryptography,"['Hedongliang Liu, Lukas Holzbaur, Antonia Wachter-Zeh (2018).
