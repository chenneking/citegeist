        Source Paper Abstract:
        Large Language Models have shown impressive per-
formance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured
and unstructured textual data. More recently, adaptions of these
models have drawn attention to their abilities to work with code
across different programming languages. On this notion, different
benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest
that certain models have programming abilities comparable
to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate
that the performance on this benchmark does not translate
to the innate ability of humans to appreciate the structural
control flow of code.
For this purpose, we extract code solutions from the Hu-
manEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform very
strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large language models have demonstrated the ability to generate both natural
language and programming language text. Such models open up the possibility of
multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize
knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation
models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about
their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for
translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We
create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using
MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18
additional programming languages.
  We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18
languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using
these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of
three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We
find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several
other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E
allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on
model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation
benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making
it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.

    The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of code generation, with various benchmarks emerging to evaluate their performance across different programming languages. A prominent theme in recent research is the exploration of multilingual capabilities in code generation models. Cassano et al. (2022) introduced MultiPL-E, a scalable and extensible system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to multiple languages, thereby creating a massively multilingual code generation benchmark. Their work highlights the potential of LLMs to generalize knowledge from one programming language to another, demonstrating that models like Codex can match or even exceed their performance on Python for several other languages. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the multi-language performance of code generation models, which is crucial for understanding the impact of language features and frequency on model performance.

Similarly, Raihan et al. (2024) addressed the limitations of existing code generation benchmarks, such as the HumanEval Benchmark, by introducing mHumanEval, a multilingual benchmark supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. Their work emphasizes the importance of task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope in evaluating code generation models. By employing machine translation methods and providing expert human translations for diverse natural languages, mHumanEval offers insights into the cross-lingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art models. This research underscores the need for benchmarks that capture the multilingual potential of LLMs, which is essential for developing models that can generate code from low-resource language prompts.

In addition to multilingual benchmarks, the concept of leveraging multi-language outputs to enhance code generation performance has been explored by Xue et al. (2024). They proposed the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), an ensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming languages to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. By treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert"" and integrating their outputs, MPLE leverages the complementary strengths of different programming languages, resulting in more accurate and robust code generation. Their approach, which achieved new state-of-the-art results on the HumanEval benchmark, highlights the potential of ensemble strategies in improving code generation quality across various LLM models.

While these studies have made significant strides in evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for code generation, they primarily focus on the semantic correctness of generated code. In contrast, our research delves into the structural understanding of code, particularly the ability of LLMs to trace execution paths. By extracting code solutions from the HumanEval benchmark and analyzing the execution traces, we reveal the limitations of current models in appreciating the structural control flow of code. Our work introduces the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which measures a model's ability to trace code execution, including advanced structural components like recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. This focus on structural reasoning complements existing benchmarks and provides a new dimension for evaluating code generation models, highlighting the need for further improvements in code reasoning abilities.

        Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced code generation from natural language prompts. The HumanEval
Benchmark, developed by OpenAI, remains the most widely used code generation
benchmark. However, this and other Code LLM benchmarks face critical
limitations, particularly in task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic
scope. Current evaluations primarily focus on English-to-Python conversion
tasks with limited test cases, potentially overestimating model performance.
While recent works have addressed test coverage and programming language (PL)
diversity, code generation from low-resource language prompts remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce mHumanEval, an extended benchmark
supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. We employ established machine
translation methods to compile the benchmark, coupled with a quality assurance
process. Furthermore, we provide expert human translations for 15 diverse
natural languages (NLs). We conclude by analyzing the multilingual code
generation capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Code LLMs, offering insights
into the current landscape of cross-lingual code generation.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved code generation,
particularly in one-pass code generation. However, most existing approaches
focus solely on generating code in a single programming language, overlooking
the potential of leveraging the multi-language capabilities of LLMs. LLMs have
varying patterns of errors across different languages, suggesting that a more
robust approach could be developed by leveraging these multi-language outputs.
In this study, we propose Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), a novel
ensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming
languages to enhance overall performance. By treating each language-specific
code generation process as an individual ""weak expert"" and effectively
integrating their outputs, our method mitigates language-specific errors and
biases. This multi-language ensemble strategy leverages the complementary
strengths of different programming languages, enabling the model to produce
more accurate and robust code. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with
commonly used techniques such as the reflection algorithm and Monte Carlo tree
search to improve code generation quality further. Experimental results show
that our framework consistently enhances baseline performance by up to 17.92%
on existing benchmarks (HumanEval and HumanEval-plus), with a standout result
of 96.25% accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art
results across various LLM models. The code will be released at

strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.

    The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of code generation, with various benchmarks emerging to evaluate their performance across different programming languages. A prominent theme in recent research is the exploration of multilingual capabilities in code generation models. Cassano et al. (2022) introduced MultiPL-E, a scalable and extensible system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to multiple languages, thereby creating a massively multilingual code generation benchmark. Their work highlights the potential of LLMs to generalize knowledge from one programming language to another, demonstrating that models like Codex can match or even exceed their performance on Python for several other languages. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the multi-language performance of code generation models, which is crucial for understanding the impact of language features and frequency on model performance.

Similarly, Raihan et al. (2024) addressed the limitations of existing code generation benchmarks, such as the HumanEval Benchmark, by introducing mHumanEval, a multilingual benchmark supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. Their work emphasizes the importance of task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope in evaluating code generation models. By employing machine translation methods and providing expert human translations for diverse natural languages, mHumanEval offers insights into the cross-lingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art models. This research underscores the need for benchmarks that capture the multilingual potential of LLMs, which is essential for developing models that can generate code from low-resource language prompts.

In addition to multilingual benchmarks, the concept of leveraging multi-language outputs to enhance code generation performance has been explored by Xue et al. (2024). They proposed the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), an ensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming languages to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. By treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert"" and integrating their outputs, MPLE leverages the complementary strengths of different programming languages, resulting in more accurate and robust code generation. Their approach, which achieved new state-of-the-art results on the HumanEval benchmark, highlights the potential of ensemble strategies in improving code generation quality across various LLM models.

While these studies have made significant strides in evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for code generation, they primarily focus on the semantic correctness of generated code. In contrast, our research delves into the structural understanding of code, particularly the ability of LLMs to trace execution paths. By extracting code solutions from the HumanEval benchmark and analyzing the execution traces, we reveal the limitations of current models in appreciating the structural control flow of code. Our work introduces the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which measures a model's ability to trace code execution, including advanced structural components like recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. This focus on structural reasoning complements existing benchmarks and provides a new dimension for evaluating code generation models, highlighting the need for further improvements in code reasoning abilities.

        The rapid growth and increased performance of Machine Learning (ML) models have amplified the importance of privacy in ML deployment. While privacy for inputs has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to the privacy of model parameters during inference. This work addresses this gap by proposing a solution that enables partial privacy in distributed ML inference using zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs). Our approach allows model providers to selectively reveal model sections, ensuring verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a customizable set of trusted and untrusted nodes --- ultimately creating trust among all participants. We present a proof-of-concept implementation, evaluate its performance, and discuss its feasibility for models of varying sizes. Our findings highlight minimal inference overhead throughout but indicate that proving and setup operations pose scalability challenges when parameter count rises. Promising applications of our solution exist in ML edge computing, and LoRA fine-tuned ML models, and we suggest future optimizations to extend support to larger models.

        Emerging Distributed AI systems are revolutionizing big data computing and
data processing capabilities with growing economic and societal impact.
However, recent studies have identified new attack surfaces and risks caused by
security, privacy, and fairness issues in AI systems. In this paper, we review
representative techniques, algorithms, and theoretical foundations for
trustworthy distributed AI through robustness guarantee, privacy protection,
and fairness awareness in distributed learning. We first provide a brief
overview of alternative architectures for distributed learning, discuss
inherent vulnerabilities for security, privacy, and fairness of AI algorithms
in distributed learning, and analyze why these problems are present in
distributed learning regardless of specific architectures. Then we provide a
unique taxonomy of countermeasures for trustworthy distributed AI, covering (1)
robustness to evasion attacks and irregular queries at inference, and
robustness to poisoning attacks, Byzantine attacks, and irregular data
distribution during training; (2) privacy protection during distributed
learning and model inference at deployment; and (3) AI fairness and governance
with respect to both data and models. We conclude with a discussion on open
challenges and future research directions toward trustworthy distributed AI,
such as the need for trustworthy AI policy guidelines, the AI
responsibility-utility co-design, and incentives and compliance.

    The increasing importance of privacy in distributed machine learning (ML) systems has been a focal point of recent research, with various approaches being explored to ensure data and model security. Wei and Liu (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions in creating trustworthy distributed AI systems, emphasizing the need for robustness, privacy, and fairness. Their work categorizes privacy protection as a critical component during both distributed learning and model inference, highlighting the vulnerabilities that exist regardless of the architecture employed. This aligns with our research focus on safeguarding model parameters during inference, as we aim to address the privacy concerns that arise in distributed ML environments by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs.

In the realm of distributed learning architectures, Zhang et al.

        Everyday, large amounts of sensitive data is distributed across mobile
phones, wearable devices, and other sensors. Traditionally, these enormous
datasets have been processed on a single system, with complex models being
trained to make valuable predictions. Distributed machine learning techniques
such as Federated and Split Learning have recently been developed to protect
user data and privacy better while ensuring high performance. Both of these
distributed learning architectures have advantages and disadvantages. In this
paper, we examine these tradeoffs and suggest a new hybrid Federated Split
Learning architecture that combines the efficiency and privacy benefits of
both. Our evaluation demonstrates how our hybrid Federated Split Learning
approach can lower the amount of processing power required by each client
running a distributed learning system, reduce training and inference time while
keeping a similar accuracy. We also discuss the resiliency of our approach to
deep learning privacy inference attacks and compare our solution to other
recently proposed benchmarks.

        Mobile edge computing (MEC) has empowered mobile devices (MDs) in supporting
artificial intelligence (AI) applications through collaborative efforts with
proximal MEC servers. Unfortunately, despite the great promise of device-edge
cooperative AI inference, data privacy becomes an increasing concern. In this
paper, we develop a privacy-aware multi-device cooperative edge inference
system for classification tasks, which integrates a distributed bidding
mechanism for the MEC server's computational resources. Intermediate feature
compression is adopted as a principled approach to minimize data privacy
leakage. To determine the bidding values and feature compression ratios in a
distributed fashion, we formulate a decentralized partially observable Markov
decision process (DEC-POMDP) model, for which, a multi-agent deep deterministic
policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in privacy-preserving
cooperative edge inference. Specifically, given a sufficient level of data
privacy protection, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.31-0.95% improvements in
classification accuracy compared to the approach being agnostic to the wireless
channel conditions. The performance is further enhanced by 1.54-1.67% by
considering the difficulties of inference data.

This aligns with our research focus on safeguarding model parameters during inference, as we aim to address the privacy concerns that arise in distributed ML environments by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs.

In the realm of distributed learning architectures, Zhang et al.

Their approach focuses on minimizing data privacy leakage through intermediate feature compression, demonstrating the potential of decentralized decision-making in enhancing privacy. Our research shares a similar objective of enabling privacy-preserving inference, particularly in edge computing scenarios. By employing zkSNARKs, we provide a mechanism for model providers to maintain control over model exposure, thus fostering trust among participants in a distributed setting.

In summary, the existing body of work highlights the critical need for privacy-preserving techniques in distributed ML systems, with various strategies being proposed to address data and model security.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        The Transformer architecture is widely regarded as the most powerful tool for natural language processing, but due to the high number of complex operations, it inherently faces the issue of extensive energy consumption. To address this issue, we consider spiking neural networks (SNN), an energy-efficient alternative to common artificial neural networks (ANN) due to their naturally event-driven way of processing information. However, this inherently makes them difficult to train, which is why many SNN-related models circumvent this issue through the conversion of pre-trained ANN networks. More recently, attempts have been made to create directly trained SNN-based adaptions of the Transformer model structure. While the results showed great promise, their sole application field was computer vision and based on incorporating encoder blocks. In this paper, we propose SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, for application on the field of natural language processing. We further analyze the impact of exchanging different blocks of the ANN model with their spike-based alternatives to identify pain points and significant sources of performance loss. Similarly, we extend our investigation to the role of residual connections and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques. Besides the work on the model architecture, we formulate and compare different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the spiking decoder block reduces the theoretical energy consumption by 87 to 93 percent compared to the power required for a regular encoder block.

        Towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence similar to the human brain,
the bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages of biological
plausibility, event-driven sparsity, and binary activation. Recently,
large-scale language models exhibit promising generalization capability, making
it a valuable issue to explore more general spike-driven models. However, the
binary spikes in existing SNNs fail to encode adequate semantic information,
placing technological challenges for generalization. This work proposes the
first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both
discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes with {0,1}
levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional,
elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the
addition nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by
direction and amplitude information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control
spike firing rate is well designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism
in language modeling, named SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general
language tasks with fully spike-driven models, which achieve much higher
accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also greatly bridges the performance
gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling. Our code is available at

    The exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the realm of natural language processing (NLP). This section reviews relevant literature that has contributed to the development of SNNs for NLP tasks, highlighting the advancements and challenges in this field.

Recent efforts to integrate SNNs into NLP have been marked by innovative approaches to spike-driven language modeling. Xing et al. (2024) introduced SpikeLM, a pioneering model that employs a fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, both discriminative and generative. The authors address the challenge of encoding semantic information with binary spikes by proposing an elastic bi-spiking mechanism that enhances spike representation through direction, amplitude, and frequency encoding. This approach significantly narrows the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling, demonstrating higher accuracy than previously possible (Xing et al., 2024). SpikeLM's contribution lies in its ability to handle general language tasks with fully spike-driven models, setting a precedent for future research in spike-based NLP.

Complementing the work on spike-driven language modeling, Knipper et al. (2024) focus on the energy-efficient application of SNNs in NLP, specifically addressing the challenge of encoding text into spike trains. Their study, SNNLP, compares various text encoding methods and introduces a novel technique that surpasses the widely-used Poisson rate-coding method by 13% in performance on sentiment analysis tasks. The authors highlight the substantial energy efficiency gains of SNNs implemented in hardware, achieving a 32x increase during inference and a 60x increase during training compared to traditional deep neural networks (Knipper et al., 2024). This work underscores the potential of SNNs to revolutionize NLP by offering a more sustainable and brain-like processing model.

Both SpikeLM and SNNLP contribute to the growing body of research that seeks to leverage the energy-efficient nature of SNNs for NLP applications. While SpikeLM focuses on enhancing spike representation for general language tasks, SNNLP emphasizes the importance of effective text encoding methods to facilitate seamless integration with SNN architectures. These studies collectively highlight the promise of SNNs in reducing energy consumption while maintaining competitive performance in NLP tasks.

Building on these foundational works, our research introduces SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, specifically designed for NLP applications. Unlike previous models that primarily focus on encoder blocks or general language tasks, SpikeDecoder targets the decoder component of the Transformer architecture, offering a novel approach to energy-efficient NLP. Our work extends the investigation into the impact of replacing ANN components with spike-based alternatives, examining residual connections and spike-compatible normalization techniques. Additionally, we explore various embedding methods to project text data into spike-range, contributing to the ongoing discourse on effective text encoding for SNNs. By demonstrating a significant reduction in theoretical energy consumption, our research positions SpikeDecoder as a promising solution for sustainable NLP, advancing the field towards more efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms.

        As spiking neural networks receive more attention, we look toward
applications of this computing paradigm in fields other than computer vision
and signal processing. One major field, underexplored in the neuromorphic
setting, is Natural Language Processing (NLP), where most state-of-the-art
solutions still heavily rely on resource-consuming and power-hungry traditional
deep learning architectures. Therefore, it is compelling to design NLP models
for neuromorphic architectures due to their low energy requirements, with the
additional benefit of a more human-brain-like operating model for processing
information. However, one of the biggest issues with bringing NLP to the
neuromorphic setting is in properly encoding text into a spike train so that it
can be seamlessly handled by both current and future SNN architectures. In this
paper, we compare various methods of encoding text as spikes and assess each
method's performance in an associated SNN on a downstream NLP task, namely,
sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we go on to propose a new method of encoding
text as spikes that outperforms a widely-used rate-coding technique, Poisson
rate-coding, by around 13\% on our benchmark NLP tasks. Subsequently, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of SNNs implemented in hardware for the
sentiment analysis task compared to traditional deep neural networks, observing
an energy efficiency increase of more than 32x during inference and 60x during
training while incurring the expected energy-performance tradeoff.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        The success of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous
successful experiences, researchers have recently explored
extending the success to the video understanding realms.
Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream
approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning
with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches
harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first
make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and
identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack
of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Animal ethology is an crucial aspect of animal research, and animal behavior
labeling is the foundation for studying animal behavior. This process typically
involves labeling video clips with behavioral semantic tags, a task that is
complex, subjective, and multimodal. With the rapid development of multimodal
large language models(LLMs), new application have emerged for animal behavior
understanding tasks in livestock scenarios. This study evaluates the visual
perception capabilities of multimodal LLMs in animal activity recognition. To
achieve this, we created piglet test data comprising close-up video clips of
individual piglets and annotated full-shot video clips. These data were used to
assess the performance of four multimodal LLMs-Video-LLaMA, MiniGPT4-Video,
Video-Chat2, and GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o)-in piglet activity understanding. Through
comprehensive evaluation across five dimensions, including counting, actor
referring, semantic correspondence, time perception, and robustness, we found
that while current multimodal LLMs require improvement in semantic
correspondence and time perception, they have initially demonstrated visual
perception capabilities for animal activity recognition. Notably, GPT-4o showed
outstanding performance, with Video-Chat2 and GPT-4o exhibiting significantly
better semantic correspondence and time perception in close-up video clips
compared to full-shot clips. The initial evaluation experiments in this study
validate the potential of multimodal large language models in livestock scene
video understanding and provide new directions and references for future
research on animal behavior video understanding. Furthermore, by deeply
exploring the influence of visual prompts on multimodal large language models,
we expect to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of animal behavior recognition
in livestock scenarios through human visual processing methods.

        The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has
recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging
their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual
reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language
Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for
understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the
substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding
compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images,
short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event
temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with
between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to
trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to
long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual
understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding,
including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and
long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements
in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for
understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing
MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss
potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.

(2024) into instruction tuning are particularly relevant to our work, as we aim to enrich the training corpus with synthesized video-like samples to improve learning efficiency and performance.

Zou et al. (2024) focus on the unique challenges posed by long video understanding, highlighting the differences between static image, short video, and long video comprehension. Their survey traces the advancements of MLLMs from image understanding to long video understanding, emphasizing the need for models to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal details and long-term dependencies. Our research addresses similar challenges by demonstrating that our proposed training scheme can enhance long video understanding without the need for extensive long video samples. This is achieved by integrating synthesized data that enriches the instruction diversity, thereby improving the model's ability to comprehend dynamic events and long-term temporal information (Zou et al., 2024).

In summary, the existing body of work on MLLMs highlights the ongoing efforts to improve visual perception, temporal understanding, and instruction tuning across various domains. Our research contributes to this field by proposing an efficient data augmentation method that leverages pre-trained image-LLMs for video understanding. By addressing the limitations of zero-shot inference and enhancing the fine-tuning process with enriched instruction diversity, our study offers a novel approach to achieving high performance with reduced sample sizes. We hope that our findings will inspire further exploration of MLLMs for video understanding and the development of high-quality data curation techniques."

        Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

        Human language offers a powerful window into our thoughts -- we tell stories,
give explanations, and express our beliefs and goals through words. Abundant
evidence also suggests that language plays a developmental role in structuring
our learning. Here, we ask: how much of human-like thinking can be captured by
learning statistical patterns in language alone? We first contribute a new
challenge benchmark for comparing humans and distributional large language
models (LLMs). Our benchmark contains two problem-solving domains (planning and
explanation generation) and is designed to require generalization to new,
out-of-distribution problems expressed in language. We find that humans are far
more robust than LLMs on this benchmark. Next, we propose a hybrid
Parse-and-Solve model, which augments distributional LLMs with a structured
symbolic reasoning module. We find that this model shows more robust adaptation
to out-of-distribution planning problems, demonstrating the promise of hybrid
AI models for more human-like reasoning.

    In recent years, the field of enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention, with various approaches being proposed to bridge the gap between human-like reasoning and machine learning models. A prominent theme in this domain is the integration of structured reasoning modules to improve the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in out-of-distribution tasks. Collins et al. (2022) introduced a hybrid Parse-and-Solve model that augments distributional LLMs with symbolic reasoning capabilities, demonstrating improved performance in planning and explanation generation tasks [1]. This approach highlights the potential of combining statistical language models with structured reasoning to achieve more human-like behavior, a concept that aligns with the objectives of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework, which seeks to enhance reasoning through reverse thinking.

Another significant theme in the literature is the augmentation of LLMs with retrieval capabilities to enhance factual accuracy and reasoning robustness. Lee et al. (2025) proposed ReaRAG, a model that integrates retrieval-augmented generation to improve the factuality of reasoning models [2]. By iteratively querying a retrieval engine, ReaRAG effectively guides reasoning steps, addressing issues of overthinking and lack of robustness. This iterative approach to reasoning is akin to the backward reasoning component of REVTHINK, where reasoning is refined by considering the problem from the solution's perspective, thus enhancing overall reasoning performance.

The exploration of reasoning strategies in LLMs has also been extensively surveyed by Bandyopadhyay et al. (2025), who provide a comprehensive overview of existing techniques and challenges in reasoning-imbued language models [3]. Their work underscores the importance of reasoning as a critical capability for complex problem-solving, which is a foundational aspect of our REVTHINK framework. Similarly, Xi et al. (2024) introduced MeTHanol, a model architecture that incorporates intermediate layer thinking to enhance reasoning capabilities [4]. This modularized approach to thinking and reasoning resonates with the multi-task learning objectives in REVTHINK, where different reasoning tasks are trained simultaneously to improve model performance.

Finally, Yang et al. (2024) addressed the challenge of reasoning self-awareness in LLMs by proposing the Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR) framework, which leverages synthetic behavioral data to enhance decision-making processes [5]. This framework's focus on distilling reasoning processes aligns with our approach of using structured forward-backward reasoning data to train models, emphasizing the importance of data-driven methods in reasoning enhancement.

In summary, the existing body of work highlights various strategies for improving reasoning in LLMs, ranging from structured reasoning modules and retrieval augmentation to modular thinking architectures and synthetic data distillation.

        Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities but rely
primarily on parametric knowledge, limiting factual accuracy. While recent
works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities,
they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their
effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose
ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries
without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction
framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we
first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action
from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query
is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation
to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is
chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach
outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its
strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning
trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating
robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Reasoning in LLMs and Vision Language Models (VLMs) aims to bridge this gap by

Reasoning is an essential capability for complex problem-solving and a
necessary step toward establishing trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This
will make AI suitable for deployment in sensitive domains, such as healthcare,
banking, law, defense, security etc. In recent times, with the advent of
powerful reasoning models like OpenAI O1 and DeepSeek R1, reasoning endowment

    In recent years, the field of enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention, with various approaches being proposed to bridge the gap between human-like reasoning and machine learning models. A prominent theme in this domain is the integration of structured reasoning modules to improve the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in out-of-distribution tasks. Collins et al. (2022) introduced a hybrid Parse-and-Solve model that augments distributional LLMs with symbolic reasoning capabilities, demonstrating improved performance in planning and explanation generation tasks [1]. This approach highlights the potential of combining statistical language models with structured reasoning to achieve more human-like behavior, a concept that aligns with the objectives of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework, which seeks to enhance reasoning through reverse thinking.

Another significant theme in the literature is the augmentation of LLMs with retrieval capabilities to enhance factual accuracy and reasoning robustness. Lee et al. (2025) proposed ReaRAG, a model that integrates retrieval-augmented generation to improve the factuality of reasoning models [2]. By iteratively querying a retrieval engine, ReaRAG effectively guides reasoning steps, addressing issues of overthinking and lack of robustness. This iterative approach to reasoning is akin to the backward reasoning component of REVTHINK, where reasoning is refined by considering the problem from the solution's perspective, thus enhancing overall reasoning performance.

The exploration of reasoning strategies in LLMs has also been extensively surveyed by Bandyopadhyay et al. (2025), who provide a comprehensive overview of existing techniques and challenges in reasoning-imbued language models [3]. Their work underscores the importance of reasoning as a critical capability for complex problem-solving, which is a foundational aspect of our REVTHINK framework. Similarly, Xi et al. (2024) introduced MeTHanol, a model architecture that incorporates intermediate layer thinking to enhance reasoning capabilities [4]. This modularized approach to thinking and reasoning resonates with the multi-task learning objectives in REVTHINK, where different reasoning tasks are trained simultaneously to improve model performance.

Finally, Yang et al. (2024) addressed the challenge of reasoning self-awareness in LLMs by proposing the Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR) framework, which leverages synthetic behavioral data to enhance decision-making processes [5]. This framework's focus on distilling reasoning processes aligns with our approach of using structured forward-backward reasoning data to train models, emphasizing the importance of data-driven methods in reasoning enhancement.

In summary, the existing body of work highlights various strategies for improving reasoning in LLMs, ranging from structured reasoning modules and retrieval augmentation to modular thinking architectures and synthetic data distillation. Our REVTHINK framework contributes to this field by introducing reverse thinking as a novel approach to reasoning enhancement, demonstrating significant improvements in reasoning performance and sample efficiency. By integrating forward and backward reasoning tasks, REVTHINK not only enhances consistency checks but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, positioning it as a promising direction for future research in reasoning-augmented language models.

        Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions
but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit great potential in complex multi-step
reasoning through inference-time thinking but still struggle with deciding when
to stop thinking due to limited self-awareness about their knowledge
boundaries. While human preference alignment has shown extraordinary
opportunities, expensive labeling challenges adherence to scaling law. Language
model self-critique, as an alternative to using human-labeled reasoning data,
is questioned with its inherited biases. This work addresses these challenges
by distilling the LLM's own reasoning processes into synthetic behavioral data,
eliminating the need for manual labeling of intermediate steps. Building on
this concept, we propose Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR), a
three-step framework that leverages the LLM's inherent behaviors as external
feedback by first generating behavioral data using the Reasoner (LLM) to
reflect its reasoning capabilities, then training a lightweight discriminative
reward model (DM) on behavioral data, and finally deploying the DM at inference
time to assist the Reasoner's decision-making. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that the DRR framework outperforms self-critique approaches
without relying on additional complex data annotation. Benefiting from
lightweight design, ease of replication, and adaptability, DRR is applicable to
a wide range of LLM-centric tasks.

        Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models.
Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based
on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time
and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical
data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be
unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological
data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization
is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data
driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method
and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The accuracy of simulation-based forecasting in chaotic systems is heavily
dependent on high-quality estimates of the system state at the time the
forecast is initialized. Data assimilation methods are used to infer these
initial conditions by systematically combining noisy, incomplete observations
and numerical models of system dynamics to produce effective estimation
schemes. We introduce amortized assimilation, a framework for learning to
assimilate in dynamical systems from sequences of noisy observations with no
need for ground truth data. We motivate the framework by extending powerful
results from self-supervised denoising to the dynamical systems setting through
the use of differentiable simulation. Experimental results across several
benchmark systems highlight the improved effectiveness of our approach over
widely-used data assimilation methods.

    Data assimilation is a critical technique for improving the accuracy of predictions in complex dynamical systems, especially when dealing with chaotic behavior and sparse observations. Recent advancements in this field have focused on integrating machine learning and deep learning methodologies to enhance the performance of traditional data assimilation frameworks. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising techniques to infer initial conditions in chaotic systems without relying on ground truth data. Their approach utilizes differentiable simulation to systematically combine noisy observations with numerical models, demonstrating improved effectiveness over conventional data assimilation methods. This work highlights the potential of learning-based frameworks to address the challenges posed by chaotic dynamics, aligning with the broader trend of incorporating machine learning into data assimilation processes.

The use of Latent Dynamics Networks (LDNets) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to encode sparse observations further enhances the robustness and accuracy of the method. This approach is particularly valuable for real-time data assimilation in complex dynamical systems, where fast and efficient processing is crucial.

        Data assimilation techniques are often confronted with challenges handling
complex high dimensional physical systems, because high precision simulation in
complex high dimensional physical systems is computationally expensive and the
exact observation functions that can be applied in these systems are difficult
to obtain. It prompts growing interest in integrating deep learning models
within data assimilation workflows, but current software packages for data
assimilation cannot handle deep learning models inside. This study presents a
novel Python package seamlessly combining data assimilation with deep neural
networks to serve as models for state transition and observation functions. The
package, named TorchDA, implements Kalman Filter, Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF), 3D Variational (3DVar), and 4D Variational (4DVar) algorithms, allowing
flexible algorithm selection based on application requirements. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on the Lorenz 63 and a two-dimensional shallow water
system demonstrate significantly enhanced performance over standalone model
predictions without assimilation. The shallow water analysis validates data
assimilation capabilities mapping between different physical quantity spaces in
either full space or reduced order space. Overall, this innovative software
package enables flexible integration of deep learning representations within
data assimilation, conferring a versatile tool to tackle complex high
dimensional dynamical systems across scientific domains.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Data assimilation techniques are crucial for correcting the trajectory when
modeling complex physical systems. A recently developed data assimilation
method, Latent Ensemble Score Filter (Latent-EnSF), has shown great promise in
addressing the key limitation of EnSF for highly sparse observations in
high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. It performs data
assimilation in a latent space for encoded states and observations in every
assimilation step, and requires costly full dynamics to be evolved in the
original space. In this paper, we introduce Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF), a
novel methodology that completely avoids the full dynamics evolution and
significantly accelerates the data assimilation process, which is especially
valuable for complex dynamical problems that require fast data assimilation in
real time. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel variant of Latent Dynamics
Networks (LDNets) to effectively capture and preserve the system's dynamics
within a very low-dimensional latent space. Additionally, we propose a new
method for encoding sparse observations into the latent space using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage not only the current step's
observations, as in Latent-EnSF, but also all previous steps, thereby improving
the accuracy and robustness of the observation encoding. We demonstrate the
robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for two challenging
dynamical systems with highly sparse (in both space and time) and noisy
observations.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        This work explores systems where source updates
require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and
analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various
system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In
parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps
with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series
setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In
practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also
consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do
not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher
update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts
processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series
setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and
solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service
rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We
focus on a special case where updates require two computational
steps.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        An optimal control problem with heterogeneous servers to minimize the average
age of information (AoI) is considered. Each server maintains a separate queue,
and each packet arriving to the system is randomly routed to one of the
servers. Assuming Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed service times,
we first derive an exact expression of the average AoI for two heterogeneous
servers. Next, to solve for the optimal average AoI, a close approximation is
derived, called the approximate AoI, this is shown to be useful for
multi-server systems as well. We show that for the optimal approximate AoI,
server utilization (ratio of arrival rate and service rate) for each server
should be same as the optimal server utilization with a single server queue.
For two identical servers, it is shown that the average AoI is approximately
5/8 times the average AoI of a single server. Furthermore, the average AoI is
shown to decrease considerably with the addition of more servers to the system.

    The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various queuing and network systems. Recent research has focused on optimizing AoI in systems with different server configurations, including heterogeneous, tandem, and preemptive server setups. This section reviews relevant literature that informs our study on optimizing AoI in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps.

Bhati et al. (2021) investigate the AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers, where each server maintains a separate queue, and packets are randomly routed. Their work derives an exact expression for the average AoI in systems with two heterogeneous servers and provides an approximation useful for multi-server systems. They demonstrate that the average AoI decreases with the addition of more servers, highlighting the benefits of parallel processing in reducing AoI. This study is relevant to our work as it underscores the importance of server utilization in optimizing AoI, a concept we explore in our parallel server setups where multiple processors work concurrently to execute all computation steps (Bhati et al., 2021).

In a related vein, Sinha et al. (2024) examine the peak AoI in systems where information traverses through queues in tandem. Their recursive framework characterizes the mean peak AoI under both preemptive and non-preemptive policies, considering servers with different service rates. This work is particularly pertinent to our series server setups, where each processor performs a specific step in sequence. The insights from their study on the impact of server service rates on AoI inform our optimization problem, which seeks to determine optimal service rates under a power budget (Sinha et al., 2024).

Yates (2018) explores AoI in networks of preemptive servers, where updates follow a route through a series of nodes, each operating as a last-come-first-served queue. The study characterizes the average AoI at each node, showing how it accumulates through successive nodes. This work is relevant to our research as it highlights the challenges of managing AoI in series processing setups, where preemption can lead to wasted processing efforts. Our study builds on these findings by identifying scenarios where processing does not reduce AoI, such as when a fresher update preempts processing in series setups (Yates, 2018).

Our research extends the existing body of work by focusing on the age-power trade-off in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. While previous studies have primarily concentrated on optimizing AoI, our work introduces the dimension of power consumption, identifying instances of wasted power when processing efforts do not lead to a reduction in AoI. By formulating and solving an optimization problem to determine optimal service rates under a power budget, we provide a novel approach to balancing AoI performance with power efficiency. This contribution is particularly significant in practical applications where power resources are limited, and efficient processing is crucial.

        This paper considers a communication system where a source sends
time-sensitive information to its destination via queues in tandem. We assume
that the arrival process as well as the service process (of each server) are
memoryless, and each of the servers has no buffer. For this setup, we develop a
recursive framework to characterize the mean peak age of information (PAoI)
under preemptive and non-preemptive policies with $N$ servers having different
service rates. For the preemptive case, the proposed framework also allows to
obtain mean age of information (AoI).

        Source Paper Abstract:
        Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical
and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new
families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper,
we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product
used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the
extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate
Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the
vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Codes in the sum-rank metric have various applications in error control for
multishot network coding, distributed storage and code-based cryptography.
Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes contain Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes as
subclasses and fulfill the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric with
equality. We propose the first known error-erasure decoder for LRS codes to
unleash their full potential for multishot network coding. The presented
syndrome-based Berlekamp-Massey-like error-erasure decoder can correct $t_F$
full errors, $t_R$ row erasures and $t_C$ column erasures up to $2t_F + t_R +
t_C \leq n-k$ in the sum-rank metric requiring at most $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
operations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, where $n$ is the code's length and $k$ its
dimension. We show how the proposed decoder can be used to correct errors in
the sum-subspace metric that occur in (noncoherent) multishot network coding.

    The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research due to their significant applications in various fields such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Hörmann, Bartz, and Puchinger (2022), who explored the error-erasure decoding of Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes in the sum-rank metric. Their research highlights the versatility of LRS codes, which encompass Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes as subclasses, and their ability to meet the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric. The authors introduced a novel error-erasure decoder that enhances the potential of LRS codes for multishot network coding, demonstrating its efficacy in correcting errors in the sum-subspace metric. This work underscores the importance of developing efficient decoding algorithms to leverage the full potential of rank-metric codes in practical applications.

In parallel, the exploration of subspace codes, which serve as the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming metric, has been extensively documented by Kurz (2021). Subspace codes are pivotal in random linear network coding and distributed storage, offering a robust framework for error correction in these settings. Kurz's survey of known constructions and upper bounds for subspace codes provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to enhance the performance and applicability of these codes. The insights from this work are instrumental in understanding the broader context of coding theory, particularly in relation to the algebraic structures and bounds that define the efficacy of various code families.

The intersection of these research efforts with our work lies in the shared goal of distinguishing and enhancing the capabilities of rank-metric codes. While Hörmann et al. focus on decoding strategies and Kurz on the structural aspects of subspace codes, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes. This invariant, inspired by the Schur product in the Hamming metric, offers a new perspective on differentiating Gabidulin codes from random ones. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code, we provide a geometric approach to understanding the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.

In conclusion, our work builds upon the foundational research of Hörmann et al. and Kurz by introducing a geometric invariant that enriches the toolkit for analyzing and distinguishing rank-metric codes. This contribution not only advances the theoretical understanding of these codes but also has potential implications for their practical applications in network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. By bridging the gap between algebraic and geometric perspectives, our research offers a novel approach to exploring the rich landscape of rank-metric codes.
