Classical transport in a maximally chaotic chain,2411.19828,"In recent years, the study of coupled dynamical systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of understanding ergodic properties and chaotic behavior. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Sala et al. (2014), which investigates the ergodic properties of two coupled Pomeau-Manneville maps. Their research highlights the anomalous statistical behavior of these systems, characterized by deviations from single intermittent maps. Through extensive numerical experiments, they demonstrate how the coupling influences the phase-space dynamics, leading to stretched exponential behavior in Lyapunov exponents and modified power-law decay in recurrence time statistics. This work underscores the importance of coupling parameters in shaping the dynamical properties of systems, a theme that resonates with our study of coupled cat maps, where the specific choice of coupling facilitates the exact determination of Lyapunov exponents (Sala et al., 2014).

Another significant contribution to the understanding of chaotic systems is the work by Chiem (2025), which focuses on the uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponent for $C^1$ monotone potentials generated by the cat map. Chiem's research demonstrates that, under sufficiently large coupling, the Lyapunov exponent remains uniformly positive across all energies. This finding is crucial for understanding the stability and chaotic nature of systems governed by cat maps, providing a theoretical foundation for analyzing the ergodic properties of such systems. Our research builds upon this by exploring how local perturbations in a lattice of coupled cat maps lead to diffusive transport in phase space, further elucidating the relationship between microscopic chaos and macroscopic diffusion (Chiem, 2025).

The construction of Arnol'd cat map lattices, as explored by Axenides et al. (2022), offers another perspective on the chaotic dynamics of coupled systems. Their work delves into the spatio-temporal chaotic properties of cat map lattices, emphasizing the role of symplectic group elements in the evolution of linearly coupled maps. By drawing parallels between cat maps and Fibonacci sequences, they provide insights into the ergodicity and mixing properties of these systems. The study of inverted harmonic oscillators and the interplay between potential runaway behavior and toroidal compactification further enriches the understanding of chaotic dynamics. Our research complements these findings by providing a model where the diffusion process can be directly inferred from the underlying chaotic dynamics, offering a tangible example of how chaos influences transport properties in phase space (Axenides et al., 2022).

In summary, the existing body of work on coupled dynamical systems, particularly those involving cat maps, provides a rich foundation for understanding the complex interplay between chaos, coupling, and ergodic properties. Our research contributes to this field by introducing a model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the spread of local perturbations and the resulting diffusive transport, we offer a novel perspective on how microscopic chaos can lead to macroscopic diffusion, thereby advancing the theoretical understanding of chaotic systems and their transport properties.",lattice models coupled cat maps Lyapunov exponents ergodic properties chaos diffusion,"['Matteo Sala, Cesar Manchein, Roberto Artuso (2014).
