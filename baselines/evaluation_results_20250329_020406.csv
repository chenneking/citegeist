        Source Paper Abstract:
        This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The commitment power of senders distinguishes Bayesian persuasion problems
from other games with (strategic) communication. Persuasion games with multiple
senders have largely studied simultaneous commitment and signalling settings.
However, many real-world instances with multiple senders have sequential
signalling. In such contexts, commitments can also be made sequentially, and
then the order of commitment by the senders -- the sender signalling last
committing first or last -- could significantly impact the equilibrium payoffs
and strategies. For a two-sender persuasion game where the senders are
partially aware of the state of the world, we find necessary and sufficient
conditions to determine when different commitment orders yield different payoff
profiles. In particular, for the two-sender setting, we show that different
payoff profiles arise if two properties hold: 1) the two senders are willing to
collaborate in persuading the receiver in some state(s); and 2) the sender
signalling second can carry out a credible threat when committing first such
that the other sender's room to design signals gets constrained.

    In the realm of Bayesian persuasion, the commitment power of senders plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics and outcomes of strategic communication games. The paper by Su and Subramanian (2022) delves into the intricacies of commitment order in Bayesian persuasion scenarios involving multiple senders. Their research highlights the impact of sequential signaling and commitment on equilibrium payoffs, particularly when senders possess partial information about the state of the world. This study provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which different commitment orders lead to distinct payoff profiles, emphasizing the collaborative potential of senders and the strategic use of credible threats. This exploration of commitment order is relevant to our work, as it underscores the importance of strategic commitment in enhancing sender payoffs, a theme central to our investigation of money-burning tactics for commitment power (Su & Subramanian, 2022).

Arieli, Babichenko, and Sandomirskiy (2022) extend the discussion of Bayesian persuasion by introducing mediators into the communication process. Their work characterizes the sender's optimal value across varying numbers of mediators, revealing that while a single mediator does not benefit the sender, the presence of a second mediator can enhance the sender's value. This geometric interpretation of constrained concavification aligns with our approach of using geometric insights to characterize sender payoffs. The notion of mediators, although distinct from our focus on money-burning, parallels our exploration of mechanisms that can alter sender-receiver dynamics, offering a complementary perspective on enhancing sender utility through strategic design (Arieli, Babichenko, & Sandomirskiy, 2022).

The concept of multi-channel communication, as explored by Babichenko et al. (2021), introduces a nuanced perspective on information dissemination in Bayesian persuasion. Their model bridges the gap between private and public persuasion by considering receivers who observe subsets of the sender's communication channels. This framework provides a comprehensive characterization of communication structures that optimize sender utility, based on information dominance among receivers. While our research does not directly address multi-channel communication, the underlying principle of optimizing sender utility through strategic communication design resonates with our investigation into money-burning tactics. The computational challenges identified in their work further highlight the complexity of designing optimal communication mechanisms, a challenge we address through our model's geometric interpretations (Babichenko et al., 2021).

Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2022) explore mediated cheap talk design, focusing on scenarios where senders lack commitment power. Their study introduces a trusted mediator who gathers data and recommends actions to the receiver, characterizing the set of implementable action distributions in equilibrium. This approach contrasts with traditional Bayesian persuasion settings, offering insights into alternative mechanisms for influencing receiver actions. While our research emphasizes the role of commitment power through money-burning, the concept of mediated communication provides a broader context for understanding how strategic mechanisms can shape sender-receiver interactions. The algorithmic solutions proposed in their work also highlight the potential for computational approaches to optimize communication strategies, a theme relevant to our geometric characterization of sender payoffs (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022).

In summary, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on strategic communication in Bayesian persuasion by introducing money-burning tactics as a novel mechanism for enhancing commitment power. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff through geometric interpretations, we offer a unique perspective that complements existing studies on commitment order, mediator influence, and multi-channel communication. Our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities further contextualizes the commitment value within contemporary digital environments, providing a practical framework for understanding and leveraging strategic communication in decentralized settings.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        An informed sender communicates with an uninformed receiver through a
sequence of uninformed mediators; agents' utilities depend on receiver's action
and the state. For any number of mediators, the sender's optimal value is
characterized. For one mediator, the characterization has a geometric meaning
of constrained concavification of sender's utility, optimal persuasion requires
the same number of signals as without mediators, and the presence of the
mediator is never profitable for the sender. Surprisingly, the second mediator
may improve the value but optimal persuasion may require more signals.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The celebrated Bayesian persuasion model considers strategic communication
between an informed agent (the sender) and uninformed decision makers (the
receivers). The current rapidly-growing literature mostly assumes a dichotomy:
either the sender is powerful enough to communicate separately with each
receiver (a.k.a. private persuasion), or she cannot communicate separately at
all (a.k.a. public persuasion). We study a model that smoothly interpolates
between the two, by considering a natural multi-channel communication structure
in which each receiver observes a subset of the sender's communication
channels. This captures, e.g., receivers on a network, where information
spillover is almost inevitable.
  We completely characterize when one communication structure is better for the
sender than another, in the sense of yielding higher optimal expected utility
universally over all prior distributions and utility functions. The
characterization is based on a simple pairwise relation among receivers - one
receiver information-dominates another if he observes at least the same
channels. We prove that a communication structure $M_1$ is (weakly) better than
$M_2$ if and only if every information-dominating pair of receivers in $M_1$ is
also such in $M_2$. We also provide an additive FPTAS for the optimal sender's
signaling scheme when the number of states is constant and the graph of
information-dominating pairs is a directed forest. Finally, we prove that
finding an optimal signaling scheme under multi-channel persuasion is,
generally, computationally harder than under both public and private
persuasion.

This study provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which different commitment orders lead to distinct payoff profiles, emphasizing the collaborative potential of senders and the strategic use of credible threats. This exploration of commitment order is relevant to our work, as it underscores the importance of strategic commitment in enhancing sender payoffs, a theme central to our investigation of money-burning tactics for commitment power (Su & Subramanian, 2022).

Arieli, Babichenko, and Sandomirskiy (2022) extend the discussion of Bayesian persuasion by introducing mediators into the communication process. Their work characterizes the sender's optimal value across varying numbers of mediators, revealing that while a single mediator does not benefit the sender, the presence of a second mediator can enhance the sender's value. This geometric interpretation of constrained concavification aligns with our approach of using geometric insights to characterize sender payoffs. The notion of mediators, although distinct from our focus on money-burning, parallels our exploration of mechanisms that can alter sender-receiver dynamics, offering a complementary perspective on enhancing sender utility through strategic design (Arieli, Babichenko, & Sandomirskiy, 2022).

The concept of multi-channel communication, as explored by Babichenko et al. (2021), introduces a nuanced perspective on information dissemination in Bayesian persuasion. Their model bridges the gap between private and public persuasion by considering receivers who observe subsets of the sender's communication channels. This framework provides a comprehensive characterization of communication structures that optimize sender utility, based on information dominance among receivers. While our research does not directly address multi-channel communication, the underlying principle of optimizing sender utility through strategic communication design resonates with our investigation into money-burning tactics. The computational challenges identified in their work further highlight the complexity of designing optimal communication mechanisms, a challenge we address through our model's geometric interpretations (Babichenko et al., 2021).

Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2022) explore mediated cheap talk design, focusing on scenarios where senders lack commitment power. Their study introduces a trusted mediator who gathers data and recommends actions to the receiver, characterizing the set of implementable action distributions in equilibrium. This approach contrasts with traditional Bayesian persuasion settings, offering insights into alternative mechanisms for influencing receiver actions. While our research emphasizes the role of commitment power through money-burning, the concept of mediated communication provides a broader context for understanding how strategic mechanisms can shape sender-receiver interactions. The algorithmic solutions proposed in their work also highlight the potential for computational approaches to optimize communication strategies, a theme relevant to our geometric characterization of sender payoffs (Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022).

In summary, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on strategic communication in Bayesian persuasion by introducing money-burning tactics as a novel mechanism for enhancing commitment power. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff through geometric interpretations, we offer a unique perspective that complements existing studies on commitment order, mediator influence, and multi-channel communication. Our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities further contextualizes the commitment value within contemporary digital environments, providing a practical framework for understanding and leveraging strategic communication in decentralized settings."

        Source Paper Abstract:
        This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We study an information design problem with two informed senders and a
receiver in which, in contrast to traditional Bayesian persuasion settings,
senders do not have commitment power. In our setting, a trusted
mediator/platform gathers data from the senders and recommends the receiver
which action to play. We characterize the set of implementable action
distributions that can be obtained in equilibrium, and provide an $O(n \log n)$
algorithm (where $n$ is the number of states) that computes the optimal
equilibrium for the senders. Additionally, we show that the optimal equilibrium
for the receiver can be obtained by a simple revelation mechanism.
