"CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not
fall out of a tree",,"The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of code generation, with numerous studies exploring their capabilities across various programming languages and benchmarks. A prominent theme in recent research is the extension of code generation benchmarks to support multilingual capabilities, as demonstrated by Cassano et al. (2022) in their work on MultiPL-E. This study introduces a scalable and extensible approach to benchmarking neural code generation by translating existing Python benchmarks into 18 additional programming languages. The authors evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models like Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder across these languages, revealing that Codex can match or exceed its Python performance in several other languages. This work highlights the importance of language diversity in evaluating LLMs and provides a framework for assessing their generalization capabilities across different programming paradigms (Cassano et al., 2022).

Similarly, Raihan et al. (2024) address the limitations of existing code generation benchmarks, particularly in terms of task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope, by introducing mHumanEval. This benchmark extends the HumanEval Benchmark to support prompts in over 200 natural languages, utilizing machine translation methods and expert human translations for 15 diverse languages. The study emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluations that consider low-resource language prompts, offering insights into the multilingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art models. By expanding the linguistic scope, mHumanEval provides a more nuanced understanding of LLM performance across different languages, which is crucial for developing robust code generation models (Raihan et al., 2024).

Another significant contribution to the field is the work by Xue et al. (2024), who propose the Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE) method. This ensemble-based approach leverages the multi-language capabilities of LLMs by treating each language-specific code generation process as a ""weak expert"" and integrating their outputs to mitigate language-specific errors and biases. The MPLE strategy enhances code generation performance by utilizing the complementary strengths of different programming languages, achieving new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like HumanEval and HumanEval-plus. This study underscores the potential of multi-language ensembles in improving the accuracy and robustness of code generation models (Xue et al., 2024).

In the context of these advancements, our research focuses on a critical aspect of code generation that has been relatively underexplored: the ability of LLMs to appreciate and trace the structural control flow of code. While existing benchmarks like HumanEval have demonstrated the impressive programming abilities of LLMs, our study reveals their limitations in tracing execution paths, particularly for complex structures such as recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming principles. By introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, we aim to bridge the gap in code reasoning abilities, providing a dataset that challenges models to navigate advanced structural components. Our work complements the existing literature by highlighting the need for improved code reasoning capabilities in LLMs, paving the way for future research to enhance their understanding of code execution flow.",Large Language Models and Code Generation,"['Federico Cassano, John Gouwar, Daniel Nguyen, Sydney Nguyen, Luna Phipps-Costin, Donald Pinckney, Ming-Ho Yee, Yangtian Zi, Carolyn Jane Anderson, Molly Q Feldman, Arjun Guha, Michael Greenberg, Abhinav Jangda (2022).

"Partially private, optimistic, distributed, and verifiable machine learning inference",,"The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) models in various applications has heightened concerns about privacy and security, particularly during the inference phase. A significant body of research has focused on ensuring the privacy of input data, but the privacy of model parameters during inference has received comparatively less attention. Recent advancements in cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, have opened new avenues for addressing these concerns. In this context, the work by South et al. (2024) introduces a method for verifiable evaluations of ML models using zkSNARKs, which allows for the creation of zero-knowledge computational proofs of model outputs. This approach enables the verification of model performance and fairness metrics without revealing the model's private weights, thus providing a new transparency paradigm for private models (South et al., 2024).

In parallel, the study of inference attacks on ML models has been a critical area of research, as these attacks can compromise the privacy of model parameters and training data. Yang (2022) provides a comprehensive risk assessment of various inference attacks, including membership inference, attribute inference, and model stealing attacks. This work highlights the potential threats posed by these attacks and establishes a taxonomy of threat models, offering insights into the factors affecting their performance and their applicability in different scenarios (Yang, 2022). The findings underscore the need for robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to protect model parameters during inference.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by addressing the gap in privacy protection for model parameters during distributed ML inference. While South et al. (2024) focus on verifiable model evaluations, our approach extends the use of zkSNARKs to enable partial privacy in distributed inference settings. By allowing model providers to selectively reveal model sections, our solution ensures verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a customizable set of trusted and untrusted nodes. This selective revelation not only enhances privacy but also fosters trust among all participants in the inference process.

In conclusion, our work contributes to the ongoing discourse on privacy in ML by proposing a novel solution that balances the need for privacy with the requirements of verifiable inference. By leveraging zkSNARKs, we provide a framework that addresses the challenges identified by both South et al. (2024) and Yang (2022), offering a scalable and efficient approach to privacy-preserving inference. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of our solution for models of varying sizes, and we identify promising applications in ML edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned models. Future optimizations will focus on extending support to larger models, further enhancing the scalability and applicability of our approach.",privacy in machine learning model parameters inference zkSNARKs,"[""Tobin South, Alexander Camuto, Shrey Jain, Shayla Nguyen, Robert Mahari, Christian Paquin, Jason Morton, Alex 'Sandy' Pentland (2024).

"SpikeDecoder: Realizing the GPT Architecture
with Spiking Neural Networks",,"The exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP). Xingrun Xing et al. (2024) in their work ""SpikeLM: Towards General Spike-Driven Language Modeling via Elastic Bi-Spiking Mechanisms"" have made notable strides in this domain by introducing a fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks. Their approach addresses the challenge of encoding semantic information in binary spikes by proposing a bi-directional, elastic amplitude, and frequency encoding mechanism. This innovation significantly narrows the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling, demonstrating the potential of spike-driven models in handling both discriminative and generative language tasks. The introduction of the elastic bi-spiking mechanism marks a pivotal advancement in the application of SNNs to NLP, providing a foundation for further exploration in this field (Xing et al., 2024).

Similarly, the work by R. Alexander Knipper et al. (2024) titled ""SNNLP: Energy-Efficient Natural Language Processing Using Spiking Neural Networks"" delves into the application of SNNs in NLP, emphasizing the energy efficiency of these models. The authors highlight the challenges of encoding text into spike trains, a critical step for integrating NLP tasks into the neuromorphic computing paradigm. By comparing various text encoding methods, they propose a novel technique that surpasses the traditional Poisson rate-coding method, achieving a 13% improvement in performance on benchmark NLP tasks. Their findings underscore the substantial energy savings of SNNs over traditional deep neural networks, with a reported 32x increase in energy efficiency during inference and 60x during training. This work not only reinforces the viability of SNNs in NLP but also provides practical insights into optimizing text encoding for spike-based models (Knipper et al., 2024).

Both of these studies underscore the growing interest in leveraging the energy-efficient properties of SNNs for NLP applications, a field traditionally dominated by power-intensive ANN architectures. The advancements in spike encoding and model design presented in these works lay the groundwork for further innovations in spike-based NLP models. They also highlight the ongoing efforts to bridge the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs, a critical step towards the widespread adoption of neuromorphic computing in language processing tasks.

In this context, our research introduces SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, specifically designed for NLP applications. Building on the foundational work of Xing et al. (2024) and Knipper et al. (2024), our study extends the application of SNNs beyond encoder blocks and computer vision, focusing on the decoder architecture within the Transformer model. By systematically analyzing the impact of replacing ANN components with spike-based alternatives, we aim to identify key areas of performance loss and optimize the integration of residual connections and normalization techniques. Furthermore, our exploration of embedding methods to project text data into spike-range complements the encoding strategies discussed in previous works. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in theoretical energy consumption, advancing the field of energy-efficient NLP and contributing to the broader discourse on sustainable AI technologies.",spiking neural networks in natural language processing,"['Xingrun Xing, Zheng Zhang, Ziyi Ni, Shitao Xiao, Yiming Ju, Siqi Fan, Yequan Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Guoqi Li (2024).

"T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image
is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs",2411.19951,"The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements, particularly in the realm of visual understanding. Recent studies have explored the application of MLLMs in various domains, including animal behavior recognition and comprehensive video understanding. Wu et al. (2024) investigate the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs in the context of animal ethology, specifically focusing on piglet activity understanding. Their study highlights the potential of MLLMs in recognizing animal activities through video data, although they note limitations in semantic correspondence and time perception. This work underscores the importance of enhancing temporal understanding in MLLMs, a challenge that is also central to our research, which aims to improve video understanding by addressing similar limitations in zero-shot inference and fine-tuning approaches.

In a broader context, Han et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements in multimodal pretrained models, emphasizing the integration of diverse data forms such as text, images, audio, and video. Their tutorial covers the evolution of multimodal research and the technical challenges faced by these models, including instruction tuning strategies to optimize performance for specific tasks. This aligns with our research focus on improving the learning efficiency of MLLMs through innovative data augmentation methods, such as our proposed T2Vid, which enriches instruction diversity and enhances training outcomes.

Zou et al. (2024) delve into the challenges of long video understanding, highlighting the unique requirements of processing sequential frames and capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Their survey traces the progression of MLLMs from image understanding to long video comprehension, identifying the need for models that can handle more complex spatiotemporal details and dynamic events. Our work contributes to this ongoing discourse by demonstrating that our training scheme can boost long video understanding performance without the need for extensive long video samples, thus addressing some of the challenges identified by Zou et al.

In summary, the existing body of work on MLLMs provides a rich foundation for exploring video understanding, with each study contributing unique insights into the capabilities and limitations of these models. Our research builds on these findings by proposing a novel data augmentation method that enhances instruction diversity, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of MLLMs in video understanding tasks.

Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners,2411.19865,"In recent years, the exploration of human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence has gained significant attention, with various frameworks proposed to enhance AI's cognitive capabilities. One such framework is AI Thinking, introduced by Denis Newman-Griffis (2024), which emphasizes the interdisciplinary application of AI across diverse contexts. AI Thinking models key decisions involved in AI use, such as motivating AI applications, formulating methods, and situating AI within sociotechnical environments. This framework highlights the importance of bridging divides between academic disciplines to reshape AI's future in practice. While AI Thinking focuses on the broader application of AI, it aligns with the goals of Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) by advocating for a more holistic approach to AI reasoning, which includes both forward and backward thinking processes (Newman-Griffis, 2024).

Another relevant approach is the multi-agent framework for lateral thinking introduced by Stefan Dernbach et al. (2024). Their work, Thinking Fast and Laterally, aims to implement System-2 reasoning capabilities in AI systems, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under uncertainty. The Streaming Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT) framework leverages dynamic communication between specialized agents to enhance reasoning through lateral information flow. This approach shares thematic similarities with REVTHINK, as both frameworks seek to enrich AI reasoning by incorporating diverse thinking strategies. While SALT emphasizes lateral thinking in streaming environments, REVTHINK focuses on reverse thinking to improve consistency checks and reasoning performance (Dernbach et al., 2024).

The concept of Thought Cloning, proposed by Shengran Hu and Jeff Clune (2023), further explores the integration of human-like thinking in AI systems. Thought Cloning aims to train AI agents to think like humans by imitating human thoughts during actions, thereby enhancing generalization, exploration, and adaptability. This framework demonstrates the benefits of thinking in language, which aligns with REVTHINK's objective of enabling large language models to perform reverse thinking. Both Thought Cloning and REVTHINK emphasize the importance of reasoning in language to improve AI's ability to handle novel situations and ensure safety and interpretability (Hu & Clune, 2023).

In summary, the exploration of human-like reasoning in AI systems is a rapidly evolving field, with frameworks such as AI Thinking, SALT, and Thought Cloning contributing valuable insights. REVTHINK builds upon these foundations by introducing a novel approach to reverse thinking, enhancing reasoning performance through structured forward-backward reasoning. By augmenting datasets and employing multi-task learning objectives, REVTHINK demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning tasks across various domains. This work not only advances the understanding of reverse thinking in AI but also highlights the potential for improved sample efficiency and generalization to out-of-distribution datasets, paving the way for more robust and versatile AI systems.",reverse thinking in AI reasoning,"['Denis Newman-Griffis (2024).

Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication,2411.19431,"In recent years, the study of mediated communication and its implications for strategic interactions has garnered significant attention. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Fan and Shen (2024), who explore revenue maximization mechanisms for an uninformed mediator with communication abilities. Their research focuses on a market setting where a mediator facilitates communication between a seller and a buyer, each possessing private information. The mediator's role is to design a communication protocol that maximizes revenue while ensuring incentive compatibility. This study highlights the potential of mediators to influence outcomes through structured communication, even when direct trading is not enforceable. The insights from Fan and Shen's work are relevant to our research as they underscore the importance of communication mechanisms in enhancing strategic outcomes, albeit in a different context of market transactions [Fan & Shen, 2024].

Another significant line of research is the exploration of mediated cheap talk, as investigated by Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2022). Their study examines a scenario with two informed senders and a receiver, where the senders lack commitment power. The authors characterize the set of implementable action distributions in equilibrium and propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal equilibrium for the senders. This work is particularly relevant to our study as it delves into the dynamics of information transmission and the role of mediators in facilitating communication without commitment power. The parallels between their findings and our exploration of money-burning tactics for commitment power highlight the diverse strategies available to enhance communication efficacy in strategic settings [Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2022].

Further extending the discussion on mediation, Arieli, Geffner, and Tennenholtz (2023) investigate the value of mediation in long cheap talk scenarios. Their research demonstrates that while a mediator may not directly benefit the sender or receiver, it can enhance the payoff of an external decision-maker affected by the receiver's actions. This study provides insights into the broader implications of mediation beyond the immediate parties involved, suggesting that mediation can create value in complex strategic environments. The findings from this research resonate with our work, as they emphasize the multifaceted benefits of mediation, which can be leveraged through innovative tactics such as money-burning to achieve desired outcomes [Arieli, Geffner, & Tennenholtz, 2023].

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by introducing a novel approach to mediated communication through money-burning tactics. Unlike previous works that focus on traditional mediation roles, our model incorporates a mechanism where the sender can enhance commitment power by strategically burning money. This approach not only improves the sender's equilibrium payoff but also offers a geometric interpretation linked to robust Bayesian persuasion. Furthermore, our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities provides a contemporary context for understanding the commitment value in decentralized environments. By integrating these elements, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on mediated communication, offering new perspectives and practical implications for strategic interactions in modern digital ecosystems.",mediated communication commitment power,"['Zhikang Fan, Weiran Shen (2024).

"Condorcet-Consistent Choice
Among Three Candidates",2411.19857,"The study of Condorcet extensions and their associated paradoxes has been a significant area of research in social choice theory. A key focus has been on understanding the computational and strategic properties of various voting rules that extend the Condorcet principle. Narodytska, Walsh, and Xia (2011) explore the manipulation of Nanson's and Baldwin's rules, which are elimination-style voting rules that have been shown to possess desirable computational properties. Their work highlights the resistance of these rules to manipulation, particularly in scenarios involving a single manipulator or a coalition of manipulators. This resistance to manipulation is relevant to our investigation of Condorcet extensions, as it underscores the importance of robustness in voting rules, a theme that resonates with our exploration of the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in Condorcet extensions.

Another significant contribution to the understanding of Condorcet-consistent rules is provided by Elkind, Faliszewski, and Slinko (2010), who examine the distance rationalizability of such rules. They focus on the Maximin rule, among others, and demonstrate how it can be rationalized using distances akin to the Hamming distance. Their findings reveal the computational complexity associated with determining winners under these rules, which parallels our investigation into the axiomatic characterizations of Maximin and its refinements. The insights from their work on the computational aspects of Condorcet-consistent rules provide a foundational backdrop for our analysis of the paradoxes affecting these rules.

The complexity of candidate nomination in elections using Condorcet-consistent rules is further explored by Schlotter and Cechlárová (2025). They analyze the Possible President problem across various voting rules, including Maximin, and provide a comprehensive computational complexity analysis. Their work delineates the boundaries of tractability for these problems, offering a nuanced understanding of the challenges involved in candidate nomination. This complements our research by highlighting the intricate dynamics of Condorcet-consistent rules in multi-candidate elections, reinforcing the need for robust solutions to paradoxes like the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes.

Darlington (2017) provides a compelling argument for the necessity of Condorcet consistency in voting systems. By systematically dismissing electoral criteria that conflict with Condorcet consistency, Darlington emphasizes the fundamental role of majority rule in two-candidate elections and its extension to multi-candidate scenarios. This perspective aligns with our focus on Condorcet extensions, as it underscores the importance of maintaining consistency with majority preferences, a principle that is central to our investigation of paradoxes in three-candidate elections.

In summary, our research builds on these foundational works by specifically addressing the susceptibility of Condorcet extensions to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes in the context of three-candidate elections. By establishing conditions under which certain refinements of the Maximin rule are immune to these paradoxes, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on the robustness and reliability of Condorcet-consistent voting rules. Our axiomatic characterizations of Maximin and its refinements further enhance the understanding of their suitability for elections, providing a nuanced perspective on the challenges and solutions associated with Condorcet extensions.",Condorcet extensions voting paradoxes three candidates maximin Nanson,"[""Nina Narodytska, Toby Walsh, Lirong Xia (2011).

Classical transport in a maximally chaotic chain,2411.19828,"In recent years, the study of chaotic dynamics in coupled map lattices has garnered significant attention, particularly in understanding the interplay between local chaos and global transport properties. A foundational work in this area is the study of Arnol'd cat map lattices by Axenides, Floratos, and Nicolis (2022), which constructs lattice field theories in both phase and configuration spaces. Their work highlights the chaotic properties of these systems through the lens of symplectic group evolution operators and the correspondence with the Fibonacci sequence. The authors demonstrate how the chaotic dynamics, characterized by a dense set of unstable periodic orbits, lead to ergodicity and mixing, with the spectrum of periods being sensitive to the interaction's strength and range. This study provides a crucial backdrop for understanding the chaotic behavior in lattice systems, which is a central theme in our research on coupled cat maps (Axenides et al., 2022).

Another significant contribution to the field is the exploration of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos by Raj and Paul (2024). They investigate a one-dimensional lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps, focusing on how varying diffusion strength affects chaotic dynamics. Their findings reveal that increasing diffusion strength initially reduces the leading Lyapunov exponent, creating a window of periodic dynamics before returning to chaos. This work is particularly relevant to our study as it provides insights into how diffusion can modulate chaotic behavior and transport properties, a phenomenon we also observe in our model of coupled cat maps. The analytical description of the Lyapunov spectrum and the spatial features of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) in their study offer a valuable framework for understanding the diffusion processes in chaotic systems (Raj & Paul, 2024).

The investigation of anomalous diffusion in single and coupled standard maps by Moges, Manos, and Skokos (2021) further enriches the discourse on chaotic transport. Their research delves into the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of standard maps, identifying conditions that lead to anomalous diffusion due to accelerator modes. They demonstrate that while individual maps may exhibit anomalous transport, the global diffusion behavior in coupled systems depends on the coupling configuration. This study underscores the complexity of diffusion processes in chaotic systems and aligns with our findings on how local perturbations in coupled cat maps lead to diffusive transport in phase space. The insights from this work help contextualize the diffusion mechanisms observed in our model, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in shaping transport properties (Moges et al., 2021).

Our research builds upon these foundational studies by introducing a novel model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the ergodic properties of the dynamics under local perturbations, we provide a unique example where diffusion can be directly inferred from microscopic chaos. This work not only contributes to the understanding of chaotic transport in coupled map lattices but also bridges the gap between local chaotic dynamics and global diffusion processes, offering new perspectives on the interplay between chaos and transport in complex systems.","lattice of coupled cat maps, Lyapunov exponents, ergodic properties, chaotic dynamics, diffusive transport in phase space","[""Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos, Stam Nicolis (2022).

Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,2411.18627,"In recent years, the field of data assimilation has seen significant advancements, particularly in the context of chaotic and complex dynamical systems. A common theme among recent studies is the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data assimilation processes. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising in dynamical systems to improve the estimation of initial conditions without relying on ground truth data. Their approach highlights the potential of differentiable simulation in enhancing data assimilation methods, which aligns with the growing trend of incorporating machine learning into traditional frameworks [1].

Similarly, Cheng et al. (2024) developed TorchDA, a Python package that integrates deep learning models within data assimilation workflows. This package supports various algorithms such as the Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, allowing for flexible application across different systems. The integration of deep neural networks as state transition and observation functions demonstrates the potential of deep learning to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional and complex physical systems [2]. This approach is particularly relevant to our work, as it underscores the importance of leveraging machine learning to improve data assimilation without relying on precise noise statistics.

Another innovative approach is presented by Xiao et al. (2024) with the LD-EnSF method, which performs data assimilation in a latent space to address the limitations of sparse observations in high-dimensional systems. By utilizing Latent Dynamics Networks and LSTM networks, this method accelerates the data assimilation process while maintaining accuracy and robustness. The focus on latent space dynamics and the use of LSTM networks for encoding observations resonate with our work's emphasis on optimizing model coefficients through topological data analysis, as both approaches aim to enhance the assimilation process without explicit noise information [3].

Cheng and Qiu (2021) explored the use of recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTM, to improve the specification of observation error covariance in data assimilation. Their data-driven approach eliminates the need for empirical assumptions about error distribution, offering a more efficient and accurate method for covariance estimation. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to refine key components of data assimilation algorithms, which is a crucial aspect of our research as we seek to optimize model performance without relying on traditional noise statistics [4].

In the context of these advancements, our research introduces a novel data assimilation algorithm grounded in topological data analysis. By focusing on the differentiability of functions of persistence, we employ gradient descent optimization to minimize topological differences between measurements and predictions. This approach not only aligns with the trend of integrating machine learning into data assimilation but also offers a unique perspective by eliminating the need for noise information. Our method's application to the chaotic Lorenz system further demonstrates its potential to enhance prediction accuracy in complex dynamical systems, contributing to the ongoing evolution of data-driven modeling techniques.",data-driven modeling dynamical systems data assimilation,"['Michael McCabe, Jed Brown (2021).

"Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update
Processing",2411.19854v1,"The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various systems, particularly those involving queuing and network setups. Several studies have explored different configurations and strategies to optimize AoI, providing a foundation for understanding the dynamics of information freshness in complex systems. This section reviews relevant literature, highlighting key contributions and their relation to our research on optimizing AoI in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps.

A significant body of work has focused on AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers. Bhati et al. (2021) investigate an optimal control problem aimed at minimizing the average AoI in systems with multiple servers, each maintaining separate queues. Their study provides exact expressions for average AoI in systems with two heterogeneous servers and extends these findings to multi-server setups, demonstrating that server utilization should be consistent across servers to achieve optimal AoI. This work is relevant to our research as it underscores the importance of server configuration in AoI optimization, particularly in parallel server setups where multiple processors execute computation steps simultaneously (Bhati et al., 2021).

Another line of research examines AoI in tandem queue systems, where information traverses through a series of servers. Sinha et al. (2024) develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak AoI under preemptive and non-preemptive policies in tandem queues with varying service rates. Their findings highlight the impact of server policies on AoI, particularly in series setups where each processor performs specific steps sequentially. Similarly, Yates (2018) explores AoI in networks of preemptive servers, demonstrating how average AoI accumulates through successive nodes in a network. These studies are pertinent to our work as they provide insights into the AoI dynamics in series server setups, where preemption and sequential processing play crucial roles (Sinha et al., 2024; Yates, 2018).

The interplay between processing speed and power consumption in tandem server systems has also been explored. Vaze and Nair (2019) address speed scaling in tandem servers, proposing algorithms that balance power consumption with processing speed to optimize performance. Their work is particularly relevant to our research, which identifies wasted power in systems where processing efforts do not lead to AoI reduction. By considering both worst-case and stochastic settings, Vaze and Nair's study provides a framework for understanding the power-AoI trade-off, which is central to our optimization problem aimed at determining optimal service rates under a power budget (Vaze & Nair, 2019).

In summary, the existing literature provides a comprehensive understanding of AoI optimization in various server configurations, highlighting the importance of server heterogeneity, preemptive policies, and speed scaling. Our research builds on these foundations by modeling and analyzing AoI performance in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps, addressing the age-power trade-off through an optimization framework. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on efficient AoI management in complex systems, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.",Age of Information parallel series server setups,"['Anhad Bhati, Sibi Raj B.

A GEOMETRIC INVARIANT OF LINEAR RANK-METRIC CODES,2411.19087,"The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research in coding theory, driven by their applicability in various domains such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A significant portion of the literature has focused on enhancing the robustness and efficiency of distributed storage systems, particularly in hostile network environments. For instance, Li et al. (2015) have explored the development of Hermitian code-based regenerating codes that surpass the MDS bound in distributed cloud storage, offering improved error correction capabilities and computational efficiency compared to traditional Reed-Solomon-based codes [1]. Similarly, their subsequent work introduced optimal constructions of regenerating codes through rate-matching, which further enhance error correction efficiency in hostile networks [2]. These contributions underscore the importance of developing codes that can maintain optimal performance under adverse conditions, a theme that resonates with the practical applications of rank-metric codes.

Another critical aspect of rank-metric codes is their security in distributed storage systems. Kadhe and Sprintson (2017) addressed the challenge of designing universally weakly secure coset coding schemes for minimum storage regenerating codes (MSR) [3]. Their work provides a framework for achieving block security without requiring users to know the underlying storage code, thus facilitating the independent design of storage and outer codes. This separation is particularly relevant in scenarios involving third-party cloud storage, where user access to the storage code may be limited. The focus on security highlights the broader applicability of rank-metric codes in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality in distributed systems.

The theoretical foundations and constructions of rank-metric codes have also been extensively studied, with particular attention to their algebraic structures and invariants. Kurz (2021) surveyed known constructions and bounds for subspace codes, which are closely related to rank-metric codes and have applications in network coding and cryptography [4]. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the mathematical underpinnings of subspace codes, offering insights into their potential for error correction and data recovery. Additionally, Gorla et al. (2023) presented the mathematical theory of sum-rank metric codes, an extension of rank-metric codes that incorporates different matrix sizes and explores invariants and optimal anticodes [5]. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the algebraic properties of rank-metric codes, paving the way for novel constructions and applications.

In the context of these existing works, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. This approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape of rank-metric codes but also offers practical tools for distinguishing between different families of codes. From a geometric perspective, our work investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code, providing a fresh lens through which to explore the algebraic structures of these codes. In doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, contributing to the ongoing evolution of rank-metric codes in coding theory.",rank-metric codes algebraic structures invariants network coding distributed storage post-quantum cryptography,"['Jian Li, Tongtong Li, Jian Ren (2015).
