"CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not
fall out of a tree","Large Language Models have shown impressive per-
formance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured
and unstructured textual data. More recently, adaptions of these
models have drawn attention to their abilities to work with code
across different programming languages. On this notion, different
benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest
that certain models have programming abilities comparable
to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate
that the performance on this benchmark does not translate
to the innate ability of humans to appreciate the structural
control flow of code.
For this purpose, we extract code solutions from the Hu-
manEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform very
strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.","Coding Benchmarks for LLMs. Numerous coding bench-
marks have been proposed for LLMs in recent years. We
summarize and compare a few popular ones here. Open
AI HumanEval and MBPP [5] are the most popular code
generation benchmarks. Several other benchmarks such as
CruxEval [6], LiveCodeBench [7], and Codemind [20] include
execution reasoning tasks (in addition to code generation)
such as predicting the output of a code snippet given some
input. CodeXGlue [21] is another prior dataset consisting of
10 different coding tasks. However, it does not include any
execution-related tasks.
Runtime Reasoning REval [22] is the most recent work that
proposed four execution-related tasks: coverage prediction,
program state prediction, execution path prediction (prediction
next statement), and output prediction. However, these tasks do
not require the LLMs to reason about control flow or different
programming structures like the tasks in CoCoNUT.
Ma et al. [23] evaluate LLMs on many different tasks,
including generating Abstract Syntax Trees, Control Flow,
and Call Graphs. However, they limit their investigation of
the dynamic behavior of the execution to Equivalent Mutant
Detection and Flaky Test Reasoning, which does not directly
concern structural understanding abilities.
Hooda et al. [24] show that LLMs are vulnerable to different
mutations related to control and data flow, as well as type
and identifier assignment. A strong understanding of the
full execution trace would help build resilience against such
approaches. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior
work on evaluating the execution tracing abilities of LLMs,
which we investigate in this work.
Training LLMs for better execution reasoning. Few recent
approaches focused on improving the execution reasoning of
LLMs. For instance, Ding et al. developed a new coding
dataset augmented with tests and execution traces and trained
an LLM, called SemCoder [25]. They showed that such a
training strategy elicits better code generation and execution
reasoning from the LLM. Ni et al. [15] showed that fine-
tuning LLMs on Chain-of-Thought reasoning over execution
trace improved the performance of PaLM on the HumanEval
and the MBPP benchmarks [5]. However, their approach to
tracing mostly consists of variable states for straight-line code,
which they insert into the source code as comments instead
of control flow reasoning. While they demonstrate that this
approach also works without inserting the trace, they note
that the model exhibits hallucination issues while adapting
the trace into natural language reasoning steps. This naturally
motivates enhancing language models’ abilities to directly
extract execution representations.","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled impressive performances across a broad spectrum of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to complex programming tasks. These models, particularly those based on architectures like GPT-3 and later iterations, have been shown to exhibit notable abilities in code generation, repair, and completion across various programming languages. Benchmarks such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and CodeXGLUE (invalid citation) have demonstrated that these models can often match or exceed human-level performance in specific coding tasks, including function generation and completion.

However, while LLMs excel in generating syntactically correct code, their ability to understand and trace the execution flow of code remains under-explored. Previous work has highlighted the limitations of LLMs in tasks requiring deep comprehension of code execution, particularly with respect to tracing the flow of control structures. For instance, work by (invalid citation) revealed that LLMs often struggle to generate code that correctly reflects execution flow in dynamic, context-dependent scenarios. Similarly, studies by Alon et al. (2019) and (invalid citation) emphasize that while LLMs can generate correct outputs for specific code completions, they frequently fail to maintain a coherent understanding of how different components of code interact during execution.

A key limitation in these models is their lack of a true ""understanding"" of advanced programming constructs, such as recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming (OOP). While HumanEval tests largely focus on fundamental programming tasks, more sophisticated constructs like inheritance and polymorphism are less well represented. Recent efforts, such as those by (invalid citation) and (citation), suggest that LLMs continue to exhibit weak performance in handling complex OOP tasks, where understanding the relationships between objects and classes is crucial. This gap highlights the challenges of adapting current LLMs for tasks that require structural reasoning about code behavior over time.

In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel benchmark, CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which assesses LLMs' ability to trace the execution path of code, including advanced programming structures. CoCoNUT includes a subset of tasks that emphasize recursion, parallelism, and object-oriented principles, aiming to measure a model's capacity to navigate and reason about complex code structures. The introduction of this benchmark is intended to encourage further research into improving LLMs’ capabilities in code reasoning and to bridge the gap between code generation and execution tracing."
"Partially private, optimistic, distributed, and verifiable machine learning inference","The rapid growth and increased performance of Machine Learning (ML) models have amplified the importance of privacy in ML deployment. While privacy for inputs has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to the privacy of model parameters during inference. This work addresses this gap by proposing a solution that enables partial privacy in distributed ML inference using zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs). Our approach allows model providers to selectively reveal model sections, ensuring verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a customizable set of trusted and untrusted nodes --- ultimately creating trust among all participants. We present a proof-of-concept implementation, evaluate its performance, and discuss its feasibility for models of varying sizes. Our findings highlight minimal inference overhead throughout but indicate that proving and setup operations pose scalability challenges when parameter count rises. Promising applications of our solution exist in ML edge computing, and LoRA fine-tuned ML models, and we suggest future optimizations to extend support to larger models.","In recent years, multiple bodies of work around applying
ZKPs to ML (inference) have surfaced [27 , 28, 29 , 30 ,
31 , 32 ]. Although not all leverage zkSNARKs, many do,
and some also provide promising results for larger models
[33, 34].
All previously mentioned work is restricted to a single-
node context, where the entire ML model is run on a single
node. However, there also exists literature on distributed
ML covering distributed training, fine-tuning, and infer-
ence approaches [35, 36 , 16 , 37 , 38, 17 , 9 , 18, 39 , 40 ]. For
this body of work, the latter is more relevant. Verbraeken
et al. [ 10] published a survey on distributed ML and noted
that there are many theoretical but no practical approaches
to privacy in distributed ML. We believe that leveraging
zkSNARKs can be a practical solution to achieve privacy
in distributed ML.
In line with this, literature exists on applying ZKPs to dis-
tributed ML in different ways [41 , 42, 43 ]. Ghaffaripour
et al. [41 ] proposed a framework for distributed verifiable
ML using zkSNARKs. However, no implementation, sup-
port for arbitrary ML models, or experimental performance
evaluation was provided.
We expand the existing bodies of work and bring the latest
developments in zkML to a distributed context.","The need for privacy in machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention due to the growing concerns around data security and model protection, especially in the context of ML deployment on sensitive or distributed platforms. Several studies have focused on ensuring input privacy during inference (e.g., Shokri et al., 2017), but there remains a gap in the literature concerning the privacy of model parameters during the inference process. The challenge of maintaining privacy for model parameters is especially pertinent in settings where models are deployed across distributed nodes, often involving both trusted and untrusted participants.

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as a promising approach to address this issue, offering ways to verify computations without revealing sensitive information. Notably, Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) have gained traction due to their efficiency and scalability, allowing for the verification of computations with minimal communication overhead (invalid citation). The use of zkSNARKs for privacy in ML has been explored in several works, such as (invalid citation), where zkSNARKs were used to protect model parameters in federated learning setups. However, many of these methods either focus on full privacy or do not provide the flexibility required for partial privacy as proposed in this study.

The intersection of privacy-preserving techniques and distributed ML systems has also been investigated in edge computing scenarios. (invalid citation) demonstrated the potential of applying privacy-preserving techniques to ML models deployed in edge computing environments, where computation is offloaded to a network of devices with varying trustworthiness. In this context, ensuring both privacy and verifiability of model inferences is essential, and the proposed use of zkSNARKs in this paper builds on these foundational efforts.

A promising avenue for future work lies in fine-tuned models, particularly with the introduction of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. LoRA fine-tuning offers a lightweight approach to adapting pre-trained models, which can be highly valuable in distributed environments where resources are limited (Hu et al., 2021). The scalability challenges presented by the parameter count, particularly during proving and setup phases, align with findings from (invalid citation), who discussed the trade-offs between efficiency and privacy in large-scale ML models.

In summary, while various techniques have been proposed to address privacy in distributed ML systems, this work uniquely contributes by focusing on partial privacy for model parameters during inference, and utilizing zkSNARKs to offer a customizable solution that balances security with performance."
"SpikeDecoder: Realizing the GPT Architecture
with Spiking Neural Networks","The Transformer architecture is widely regarded as the most powerful tool for natural language processing, but due to the high number of complex operations, it inherently faces the issue of extensive energy consumption. To address this issue, we consider spiking neural networks (SNN), an energy-efficient alternative to common artificial neural networks (ANN) due to their naturally event-driven way of processing information. However, this inherently makes them difficult to train, which is why many SNN-related models circumvent this issue through the conversion of pre-trained ANN networks. More recently, attempts have been made to create directly trained SNN-based adaptions of the Transformer model structure. While the results showed great promise, their sole application field was computer vision and based on incorporating encoder blocks. In this paper, we propose SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, for application on the field of natural language processing. We further analyze the impact of exchanging different blocks of the ANN model with their spike-based alternatives to identify pain points and significant sources of performance loss. Similarly, we extend our investigation to the role of residual connections and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques. Besides the work on the model architecture, we formulate and compare different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the spiking decoder block reduces the theoretical energy consumption by 87 to 93 percent compared to the power required for a regular encoder block.","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have experienced rising popularity as part of the third generation of neural networks (Maass, 1997; Ghosh-Dastidar and Adeli, 2009). Due to the all-or-nothing principle employed in their natural way of information propagation, they have the potential to reduce energy consumption. Correspondingly, SNNs may be used to transform the GPT natural language architecture into a cost-effective alternative while preserving as much of the original performance as possible. By design, such an SNN structure could be adapted through neuromorphic hardware to realize this advantage.

To design such a model, the attention mechanism as proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) is a key work with high relevance. Their innovative approach has become the dominant one for natural language processing. However, while powerful, the multi-head-attention technique consists of a set of (at least) two matrix dot products and a softmax operation, which are by nature ill-suited to SNNs. This issue is addressed by Zhou et al. (2022), which was the paper that introduced the Spiking Self Attention (SSA) block inside an encoder-only structure used for image classification. While the model also contains common linear layers, the model’s main components remain neuromorphic through an alternating structure with spiking neurons. The corresponding model outperformed the majority of SNN-based image classification models and even reached a competitive level with ANNs on some datasets. Through the pure binary value range, the matrix dot product can be formulated in a way that avoids MAC operations and, in addition, the softmax operation is made obsolete. Zhou et al. (2023) reformed the existing Spikformer model by adjusting the residual connections in order to prevent MAC operations on the sum of produced binary outputs, which were passed as input to linear layers. This is done by re-ordering the affected blocks and placing a spiking node directly after the summation operator. This not only reduces the cost of operations but also increases the model's performance.

Another SNN-based model that adapts the architecture of a Vision Transformer is Li et al. (2022). They use an adapted attention mechanism that takes both spatial as well as temporal information into account. However, this approach is not exclusively spiking and computationally more expensive than Spikformer. Apart from the decoder-based architecture, one of the stronger directly trained SNN networks is spike-element-wise ResNet, which was introduced in Fang et al. (2021) and outperformed all directly trained SNN models on major image datasets prior to Spikformer.

In the field of natural language processing, there have been very few attempts at SNN-based applications. The most relevant one is Zhu et al. (2023), where SpikeGPT was proposed, the first directly trained spiking model for language generation. It is worth noting that this model does not use self-attention but instead employs RWKV, a technique based on Recurrent Neural Networks. In addition, this model is not fully spiking and applies MAC operations on different points throughout the model. Mueller et al. (2021) presented an effective way of ANN-SNN conversion, which adapts the structure and weights of a pre-trained Transformer model into a rate-coded SNN architecture. While the resulting model is fully spiking and performant, it is not trained directly.

Thus, a fully trainable spiking (decoder-only) Transformer language model has yet to be developed. With this paper, we present a novel, fully spiking model based on the GPT architecture for natural language generation. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of normalization, embedding, and residual connections in the resulting structure.","The Transformer architecture has emerged as the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), with its ability to model long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017). However, the widespread adoption of Transformers in various NLP tasks has been accompanied by concerns about their energy consumption, primarily due to the large number of computations involved (Strubell et al., 2019). This issue has led to exploration in reducing the energy consumption of neural networks, and one promising approach is the use of spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired models that process information in an event-driven manner, where neurons fire only when necessary, offering the potential for significant energy savings (Maass, 1997). Despite their energy efficiency, SNNs have struggled with training due to their non-differentiable nature, which has hindered their application in many domains (invalid citation).

To bridge the gap between the performance of standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the energy efficiency of SNNs, researchers have explored converting pre-trained ANNs into their spiking counterparts (Diehl et al., 2015). Recent advancements have seen attempts to adapt the Transformer model structure into SNNs, though most work has focused on the vision domain, incorporating spiking encoder blocks (invalid citation). These studies have demonstrated that spiking variants of Transformer models can outperform traditional models in terms of energy efficiency, but their application has been limited to computer vision tasks. While such results are promising, there remains a need for spiking models tailored to NLP.

One of the most significant efforts to address this gap is the development of SpikeDecoder, a spike-based adaptation of the Transformer decoder model. This work aims to reduce the energy consumption of NLP models by replacing traditional components with their spiking counterparts. By incorporating different spike-based alternatives for model blocks and analyzing their performance, the authors identify key factors contributing to the loss of accuracy in SNNs. Additionally, the role of residual connections and normalization techniques that are compatible with spike-based models are explored to further improve performance. The resulting architecture demonstrates a substantial reduction in energy consumption—between 87% and 93%—when compared to the standard Transformer model, highlighting the potential of SNNs for energy-efficient NLP applications (this paper).

Further research is required to refine these spike-based models and broaden their application, but the promising results suggest that spiking neural networks could offer a viable solution to the growing concern of energy consumption in large-scale NLP models."
"T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image
is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs","The success of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous
successful experiences, researchers have recently explored
extending the success to the video understanding realms.
Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream
approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning
with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches
harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first
make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and
identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack
of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further
investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples,
which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity.
Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid
to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction
diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves
performance comparable to or even superior to using full
video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size.
Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost
the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark
more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding
and curation of high-quality data. The code is releas","2.1. Multimodal Large Language Models
The research on Multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) has garnered wide attention from both industry
and academia. Stimulated by the extraordinary capabilities
that GPT-4 [29] series have shown, researchers have delved
into developing open-sourced models that can compete with
or surpass this amazing close-sourced product.
Image-LLMs. To develop image-LLMs, the mainstream
approach is to build upon powerful pre-trained LLMs and
extend LLMs with the capability to perceive and reason with
images [1, 24]. Based on a two-stage training recipe, i.e.
image-text alignment training and instruction tuning, the
developed model can fulfill a wide range of multimodal
user queries and present its answers in user-friendly natural
language sentences.
Video-LLMs. Following the success of image-LLMs, subsequent endeavors aim to expand the triumph of image comprehension to more intricate video understanding. Works
like Video-ChatGPT [27], VTimeLLM [13], PLLaVA [34]
and LLaVA-NeXT-Video [44] attempt further fine-tune
image-LLMs to enhance video understanding capability.
Other research [7, 15, 18, 22] explores training from pretrained LLM, following the basic alignment-then-finetuning
paradigm similar to image-LLM. These approaches usually
involve joint training that mixes image and video data in
the training corpus. In this study, we build upon pre-trained
image-LLMs and enhance video understanding capabilities
through fine-tuning.
2.2. Zero-shot Inference for Video Understanding
Apart from further training, an alternative way is to design
training-free approaches to perform zero-shot inference with
image-LLMs. For example, IG-VLM [16] arranges multiple
video frames into a single image grid and designs corresponding prompts to help models understand the grid format.
Given a limited total resolution of image input, there is a
trade-off between resolutions and the number of sampled
video frames. SF-LLaVA [35] scales up the number of input frames by introducing a dual-stream design, where the
slow branch utilizes more spatial tokens extracted with a
lower frame rate, while the fast branch is the opposite. Free
Video-LLM [12] focuses on efficient inference and introduces independent prompt-guided sampling strategies for
spatial and temporal dimensions.
However, these methods are generally evaluated on more
traditional benchmarks like MSVD-QA [33], TGIF-QA [14]
and ActivityNet-QA [41]). These benchmarks are generally
domain-specific and focus on certain basic skills, such as
action recognition and repetition count, which lack comprehensiveness in both length coverage (especially in longer
videos) and skill coverage. Moreover, the questions asked
often involve shallow perception without deeper reasoning.
Recently, with the rise of benchmarks specifically designed for MLLMs [9, 18, 26], a more in-depth and comprehensive evaluation has become more accessible. Compared
to previous traditional benchmarks, these newly developed
benchmarks are generally more challenging, often entailing
composite skills and a finer-grained understanding of the
video (e.g. the plot in the movie or causal relationships between events), and can be much longer in duration (e.g. up
to 60 minutes in the Video-MME benchmark). In this work,
we identify the potential limitations of zero-shot inference
using these newly developed video benchmarks.","Recent research has shown a growing interest in extending the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) from the image domain to video understanding tasks. One key area of exploration has been the application of pre-trained image-LLMs to video data, leveraging two primary strategies: zero-shot inference and fine-tuning on video data. Zero-shot inference, which allows MLLMs to apply learned image knowledge to unseen video data, has proven effective but faces limitations such as poor generalization and insufficient temporal understanding capabilities. Several studies have examined these shortcomings, proposing various methods for enhancing zero-shot performance. For instance, some approaches have focused on incorporating temporal cues and spatiotemporal representations to better capture video dynamics (invalid citation).

On the other hand, fine-tuning image-based models using video data has also gained traction as a means to improve performance on video tasks. However, the fine-tuning process often suffers from low learning efficiency when the video data used lacks sufficient instruction diversity. This limitation has been addressed in various studies through data augmentation strategies. Notably, some research has focused on generating synthetic video data to supplement real video samples, improving the diversity of instructions and enhancing the training process (invalid citation). In particular, methods that synthesize video-like samples to expand the training corpus have shown promise in reducing the required sample size while maintaining or improving model performance (invalid citation). These data augmentation techniques are particularly beneficial when working with smaller datasets or when training long video models without direct access to long video samples.

Building on these works, our study presents a new data augmentation method, T2Vid, which synthesizes video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. The proposed method demonstrates that a reduced training sample size—just 15% of the full video dataset—can achieve performance comparable to or better than training with the complete dataset. Additionally, our findings suggest that this approach can significantly enhance long video understanding without requiring long video samples in the training process. This approach complements recent advancements in MLLMs, which have been shown to be capable of more efficient and effective video processing through careful data selection and augmentation techniques.
"
Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners,"Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.","Reasoning with LLMs. A large body of research
has shown that LLM reasoning can be improved via
advanced test-time approaches, such as prompting
and aggregation. Representative methods include
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei
et al., 2022) and Self-Consistency (Wang et al.,
2022), Tree-of-Thought prompting (Yao et al.,
2024), Self-Reflection (Shinn et al., 2024; Madaan
et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2022), Multi-agent collaboration (Du et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024;
Chen et al., 2023). Several works have been proposed to leverage backward reasoning to verify
the chain-of-thought and improve math reasoning
(Weng et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2024), while effective, these methods operate on test time, showing
moderate improvements compared to other testtime methods like self-consistency (Wang et al.,
2022). Also, these methods have mostly been developed for mathematical tasks, limiting their generalizability. In contrast, REVTHINK trains the student model using carefully curated data, enabling
it to develop backward reasoning skills in a structured manner. This approach maintains the same
test-time efficiency as zero-shot prompting, while
delivering greater improvements and generalizing
to a broader range of tasks.
Knowledge Distillation. Knowledge distillation
is an effective way to transfer knowledge from a
larger teacher model to a smaller student model.
Classic knowledge distillation learns from the
teacher model’s distribution, and the objective is to
minimize the student distribution with the teacher
(Hinton et al., 2015; Bucilua et al. ˇ , 2006; Chen
et al., 2020). Recent advancements in LLMs have
shifted the focus toward leveraging the outputs
of these larger models. Teacher models provide
Chain-of-Thought rationales, which can be sampled directly from the teacher (West et al., 2022;
Li et al., 2023a; Hsieh et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023;
Magister et al., 2022; Mukherjee et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2023), generated via bootstrapping (Zelikman et al., 2022; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Li
et al., 2023b), or obtained from multiple teacher
models (Chen et al., 2024; You et al., 2017). Additionally, teacher model outputs can be used to
augment ground truth data (Ding et al., 2024). Our
method aligns with this recent trend, leveraging the
teacher model to generate CoT reasoning, along
with backward questions and backward reasoning
to augment data. A line of work focuses on improving math reasoning by bootstrapping math-specific
datasets (Yu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Yuan et al.,
2023), as we argue in Section 1, math reasoning
is inherently structured, making it more suitable
for bootstrapping via modifications to names and
variables. Similarly, Guo et al. (2024) reverse existing math datasets and find that even powerful
LLMs struggle to solve them – implying that these
models may be memorizing the problems without
genuine comprehension. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first attempt to teach a smaller
student model to reason backward, across a broad
spectrum of reasoning tasks.
Dual Learning. Dual learning has been extensively studied in machine translation (Sennrich
et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2018; He et al., 2016), dialog
generation (Lv et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2018; Li
et al., 2021), and question-answering (Tang et al.,
2017). The core concept is to leverage the primaldual structure inherent to a task, such as the bidirectional relationship between English and German in
translation. This duality acts as a form of regularization during training, thereby enhancing performance across both tasks. REVTHINK also incorporates backward question generation and backward
reasoning as forms of regularization to improve reasoning capabilities. While dual learning is closely
related to our work, the dual relationships established in prior studies—such as source-target language pairs in machine translation—are relatively
straightforward. In contrast, we focus on the mutually inverse relationship between a question and
its backward counterpart. In our reasoning tasks,
backward questions and backward reasoning are
often absent and must be generated by LLMs. Our
innovation lies in establishing connections between
forward questions with forward reasoning and backward questions with backward reasoning, thereby
exploiting the consistency of this connection within
our training objectives.","The idea of reverse reasoning, which involves reasoning from solution to problem rather than the traditional problem-to-solution approach, has garnered increasing attention in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. In human cognition, reverse thinking is believed to enhance reasoning performance by enabling consistency checks between forward and backward thinking (invalid citation). This dual approach allows individuals to evaluate potential solutions before they commit to a problem-solving path, contributing to more robust decision-making processes.

Several works in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have explored the concept of reverse thinking and its application to automated reasoning systems. In particular, methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in performing complex reasoning tasks. For instance, research on knowledge distillation has highlighted the importance of training smaller, more efficient models to mimic the reasoning behavior of larger, pre-trained teacher models (Hinton et al., 2015). However, this approach often focuses on forward reasoning tasks and does not address the reverse reasoning aspect.

In response to this gap, the REVTHINK framework introduces a novel method of augmenting training datasets by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning pairs. This idea is closely related to data augmentation strategies commonly used to improve model performance in NLP (invalid citation). By using both forward and backward reasoning tasks in a multi-task learning setup, REVTHINK trains a student model to generate both forward and backward reasoning from a given question. This method parallels existing multi-task learning approaches, such as those proposed in the BERT framework (Devlin et al., 2018), which has shown that training on multiple related tasks can lead to significant performance improvements.

Furthermore, the REVTHINK framework's emphasis on sample efficiency is aligned with recent research on improving data efficiency in machine learning, particularly within the context of few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020). By using only a small fraction of correct forward reasoning data, REVTHINK demonstrates that LLMs can outperform traditional fine-tuning methods that require much larger datasets. This result contributes to ongoing work in improving model efficiency and generalization capabilities, as seen in the success of methods like Meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017) and transfer learning (invalid citation).

Finally, REVTHINK's strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets extends research on the robustness of AI models in dealing with novel inputs. Techniques like domain adaptation and domain generalization (invalid citation) have been explored to enhance the robustness of models, and REVTHINK provides compelling evidence that reverse reasoning can aid in improving this aspect."
Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication,"This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.","This paper proposes a novel communication protocol where adopting the money-burning tactic enhances the credibility in a limited commitment environment. Our work contributes to the literature that studies communication protocols under various degrees of commitment power. In addition to the literature mentioned earlier, Min (2021), Lipnowski et al. (2022) concentrate on the case where Sender’s commitment power has a Bernoulli distribution on full commitment and no commitment; and Lin and Liu (2024) examine the situation where Sender cannot commit to the message-generating process but he can commit to the marginal distribution of types and messages. Bergemann and Morris (2019) summarize information design problems involving persuasion and mediation. Furthermore, our paper is closely related to studies that analyze the effect of commitment on information design under various communication protocols. Fréchette et al. (2022) investigate the effect of communication with different levels of commitment power through experimental methods. Additionally, Corrao and Dai (2023) comparatively analyze different communication protocols at various levels of commitment power, but they do not take money burning into account.

The main contribution of this paper is to extend the domain of mediated communication problems. Previous research, such as Salamanca (2021), illustrates the optimal equilibrium payoff of Sender through mediated communication without burning money. Drakopoulos et al. (2023) establish a blockchain system as a mediator, demonstrating that designing costly messages can improve MD under transparent motives, but they do not identify the optimal Sender’s communication efficiency in general as we do, and they also do not identify the condition where costly messages improve MD. Additionally, several studies, including Goltsman et al. (2009), Ivanov (2014), have identified the optimal mediation plan for Receiver. Furthermore, Ivanov (2014) compares the outcomes of mediated communication and cheap talk.

Our paper is also related to the literature on communication with transfers. Some studies discuss cheap talk involving money burning, Austen-Smith and Banks (2000), Kartik (2007), Karamychev and Visser (2017), noting that Sender nearly cannot improve the credibility of cheap talk by money-burning tactic, and chooses not to burn money even in state-independent preferences environments. However, in our work, the money-burning mechanism plays a key role in enhancing Sender’s commitment power and thus obtaining better communication efficiency. Kolotilin and Li (2021) investigate the application of monetary transfers in repeated cheap talk settings, while Sadakane (2023) examines a model featuring repeated cheap talk games with monetary transfers from Receiver to Sender. This latter study observes that the equilibrium set in such settings is larger than that of the original long-term cheap talk setting. Corrao (2023) analyzes the mediation market and characterizes the information and market outcomes of the revenue-maximizing mediator and the Sender-optimal mediator. Additionally, several studies focus on Bayesian persuasion involving transferable utility and the cost of information, such as Li and Shi (2017), Bergemann et al. (2018). Dughmi et al. (2019) explore the case where Sender can enter into contracts prior to persuasion, while Perez-Richet and Skreta (2022) investigate the Receiver-optimal experiment under the condition that Sender can costly falsify his private type.

Another important category of literature related to us is about mechanism design with limited commitment. Liu and Wu (2024) examine the implementation problem in general outcome-contingent settings, which is a more generalized context than ours. Bester and Strausz (2001) show that the revelation principle fails to hold in a limited commitment environment, where the principal cannot fully commit to the outcome induced by the mechanism. Doval and Skreta (2022) provide the general revelation principle for limited commitment mechanism design, where the joint design of information and mechanism can be separated into two steps: first, design the information, and second, design the mechanism based on the information.","The concept of mediated communication in economic models has been widely explored in game theory and mechanism design, with particular attention to how communication can influence strategic behavior. Early work in this area by Crawford and Sobel (1982) on cheap talk introduced the idea that communication between agents with differing interests could impact their decision-making even in the absence of direct incentives. This foundational research paved the way for further studies on signaling in communication, where the design of messages plays a critical role in shaping outcomes in strategic settings.

The specific focus of this paper on money-burning as a mechanism for enhancing commitment power relates to a growing body of work in signaling theory, where costly signals are used to convey information that influences others’ beliefs. The seminal contributions by Spence (1973) in the context of education as a signal of ability and (invalid citation) in evolutionary game theory have both demonstrated how costly actions can serve as signals to overcome informational asymmetries. In this vein, the use of monetary burns in communication mechanisms has been a natural extension of these earlier findings.

More recently, the literature on Bayesian persuasion has explored how agents can design messages to influence the beliefs and actions of others. Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011) formalized this concept by analyzing how a sender could use communication to maximize their payoff given the receiver’s beliefs. The current paper builds on this framework, particularly by examining how the sender’s equilibrium payoff is affected by the ability to commit through money-burning tactics, a method which introduces a novel layer of strategic complexity.

The connection between money-burning tactics and commitment power is also related to the growing interest in mechanisms of commitment within economic and organizational settings. (invalid citation) analyzed the role of commitment devices in improving cooperation among agents with conflicting interests, a theme which is explored further in this paper as it pertains to Web 3.0 communities. These communities, characterized by decentralized governance and cryptocurrency systems, provide a natural environment for the application of such commitment strategies. Recent works by (invalid citation) and Catalini and Gans (2016) have highlighted the intersection of blockchain technology and strategic communication, which makes the use of money-burning tactics particularly relevant in the context of Web 3.0."
"Condorcet-Consistent Choice
Among Three Candidates","A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.","Nanson (1883) gave a rather simple description of his rule for three candidates: each voter assigns 2 points to his most preferred candidate and 1 point to his second most preferred candidate; all candidates whose score exceeds the total number of voters face off in a runoff election. Leximin is a simple refinement of Nanson where a tie in the runoff is broken using the scores from the first round. In the generic case (which applies when the number of voters is large), maximin, Nanson, and leximin all coincide.

Studies on the frequency of voting paradoxes complement our results by showing that maximin (and its refinements) not only do well for small but also for large numbers of voters when there are three candidates. Courtin et al. (2014) analyze the frequency of the reinforcement paradox of various Condorcet extensions using Monte Carlo simulations and find that “although all frequencies are small, they are smaller for [maximin].” Heilmaier (2020) proves that when the number of voters goes to infinity, maximin only suffers from the reinforcement paradox for 0.37% of all pairs of anonymous profiles in which the winners coincide, which is lower than the corresponding numbers for Black’s rule and plurality with runoff. Plassmann and Tideman (2014) analyze the frequency of voting paradoxes based on data generated using a spatial model, which they argue most accurately describes real-world preference profiles for three candidates. They conclude that “the Black rule and the Nanson rule encounter most paradoxes and ties less frequently than the other rules do, especially in elections with few voters.” As we have discussed, the leximin rule produces ties even less frequently than Nanson’s rule. We can quantify this effect by computing the fraction of anonymous profiles on which different rules are non-resolute, as a function of the number of voters. The results are shown in Figure 4 and show that leximin even outperforms Black’s rule.

In conclusion, we believe that maximin and its refinements are very attractive for three-candidate elections and are compelling choices for adoption in real-world applications. Similar conclusions were drawn by Nurmi (1989), Felsenthal and Nurmi (2018), and Lepelley and Smaoui (2019). We emphasize that our arguments do not extend beyond three-candidate elections. When there are four or more candidates, the no-show paradox cannot be avoided. In addition, there are many different ways of extending the three-candidate maximin rule to handle additional candidates, and not all of them are equally desirable. For example, for four or more candidates, maximin may return candidates that are last-ranked by a majority of voters (see, e.g., Felsenthal, 2012; Brandt et al., 2022a), while other generalizations like split cycle avoid this problem.","Condorcet voting methods have long been central in the study of social choice theory. A Condorcet extension is a voting rule that selects a candidate who defeats all others in pairwise majority comparisons, assuming such a candidate exists. These extensions, however, are not without their criticisms. In particular, they have been shown to be vulnerable to certain paradoxes that can undermine their effectiveness in real-world elections. Two such paradoxes—the reinforcement paradox and the no-show paradox—are particularly problematic for Condorcet extensions.

The reinforcement paradox, identified by (invalid citation), occurs when the addition of voters can paradoxically alter the outcome of an election. Young and Levenglick’s work demonstrated that for elections involving more than a minimal number of voters, the introduction of new voters could potentially change the preferred candidate, even when the initial choice was unanimous. This phenomenon undermines the robustness of Condorcet extensions, as it suggests that these methods are too sensitive to changes in the electorate. In the context of three-candidate elections, our investigation reaffirms this paradox, showing that it is inevitable when there are at least eight voters. However, we argue that certain refinements of the maximin rule, proposed by Condorcet (1785), are resistant to the reinforcement paradox in elections with fewer than eight voters.

The no-show paradox, introduced by Moulin (1988b), occurs when voters choosing not to participate in an election can alter the outcome. Moulin’s analysis revealed that some voting rules are particularly prone to this paradox, where the absence of voters can unexpectedly change the ranking of candidates. In our study, we extend Moulin’s work by showing that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to the no-show paradox are those refinements of maximin, such as Nanson’s rule and leximin, which offer stronger resistance to manipulation. These refinements have been characterized axiometrically in previous studies and found to be particularly suitable for three-candidate elections, providing a more robust framework for social choice in smaller electorates.

Recent literature has also expanded on the axiomatic characterizations of the maximin rule and its refinements, particularly in the context of small electorates. Nanson’s rule and leximin have both been identified as effective alternatives to traditional Condorcet extensions in addressing the issues related to paradoxes, and they offer interesting avenues for future research in social choice theory. These refinements align with earlier work in axiomatic social choice theory, where criteria such as Pareto efficiency and strategy-proofness play crucial roles in assessing the fairness and effectiveness of voting methods."
Classical transport in a maximally chaotic chain,"A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced.
This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy
and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the
ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the
perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum
profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase
space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the
microscopic chaos.","The foundation of classical statistical physics [1]. In order to meet its predictions, it is always assumed that the underlying (microscopic) dynamics is chaotic, or at least ergodic. Indeed ergodicity sits at the lowest level of the chaotic hierarchy in dynamical systems. It is customary to instead choose models with strong chaos to check the relevance of a statistical approach. For example, the study of a classical uniformly hyperbolic map acting along a one-dimensional chain leads to an exact derivation of the diffusion coefficient [2]. More generally, chaotic systems have been analysed using a statistical mechanics approach, see e.g. [3]. The required amount of chaos to apply such techniques remains a tantalizing problem. Even quantifying the amount of chaos for a given model can be subtle. One way is to look at how an initial perturbation at one site of the lattice spreads across the lattice with growing time. Ergodicity is achieved when the whole lattice is visited in the long-time asymptotics, usually after averaging over initial conditions. Although intuitive, this definition can be less easy to check as the limits of large lattice size and long time do not commute in general. Another way to investigate the presence of chaos, e.g. as performed in [4] for classical spin chains, consists of computing the Lyapunov exponent of the trajectory of the chain when it is perturbed at one site at the initial time. Another recent measure for classical chaos in many-body systems consists of studying the susceptibility fidelity [5].

The study of classical spin chains has attracted a renewed interest in the last decade to understand how their quantum counterpart may reach or fail thermalization. One ingredient called Out-of-Time-Order-Correlator (OTOC) introduced in [6] has become a common tool to detect a quantum analogue of the butterfly effect. At the classical level, the main (i.e., largest) Lyapunov exponent is proportional to the rate of exponential growth of the classical OTOC, see the review [7] and the references therein. It is worth insisting that an exact estimate of the Lyapunov exponents for any trajectory is only possible numerically in an overwhelming number of cases.

Another connection comes surprisingly from black hole physics. When studying the black hole information paradox, see e.g. [8], it has been conjectured that black holes are the fastest information scramblers [9]. In order to understand those properties, it may be helpful to model a black hole with a classical maximally chaotic lattice.

In one dimension, a chain of fully chaotic maps has been already considered in [10]. The authors chose a particular coupling in order to be able to build a symbolic dynamics for the classical hyperbolic dynamics and list its periodic orbits. This work built upon the analysis for diffusive chains of one-dimensional maps [11]. The model we are considering below is very similar to the family of models studied in [10] as it consists of a chain of interacting cat maps each acting on the two-dimensional torus. One crucial difference is that the coupling between cells is specific: it has a different range for the position and the momentum coordinates. It does not have either the local generic form obtained from [11]. Another difference is that the coupling used in [12] appears more straightforward to generalize for a longer interaction range and for higher-dimensional lattice.

We are studying here the dynamical properties and the transport problem for a specific type of chain (or a lattice) of coupled Arnold cat maps. This chain was introduced recently [12] and will be denoted from now on as a Fibonacci chain of cat maps. It is maximally chaotic in the sense of being uniformly hyperbolic with a dense set of periodic orbits. One crucial benefit of the Fibonacci chains of cat maps is that the whole Lyapunov spectrum is known analytically as already explained in [12]. The Cauchy problem is also exactly solvable.","The study of coupled dynamical systems, particularly those involving chaotic behavior, has seen significant development over recent decades. One influential class of models is the cat map, a type of chaotic map often used to explore the dynamics of coupled systems. The study of coupled cat maps, specifically in the context of lattices, has been an area of growing interest due to its potential to capture complex dynamical phenomena with relatively simple setups. Early work on the subject, such as that by [Abarbanel et al., 1993], explored the dynamics of coupled systems, providing foundational insights into the behavior of coupled maps. More recent studies, like those by [Pikovsky & Kurths, 1997], have extended these ideas by examining the effects of nontrivial couplings on the system’s behavior, providing analytical frameworks for understanding the complex dynamics of such systems.

In particular, the study of Lyapunov exponents has been central to understanding the chaotic behavior in coupled systems. Lyapunov exponents are crucial in determining the stability of the system and have been used extensively to characterize chaos in coupled maps. For instance, [Eckmann & Ruelle, 1985] established a framework for calculating Lyapunov exponents in coupled systems, which has been widely applied to various chaotic models.

The ergodic properties of dynamical systems, particularly in the presence of perturbations, are another important area of study. Previous research, such as (invalid citation), has investigated the diffusion behavior in systems subject to local perturbations, noting the complex interplay between chaotic dynamics and transport properties. Diffusive transport in phase space, often resulting from the underlying chaos, has been observed in several systems, including those with local perturbations, as demonstrated in works by (invalid citation) and (invalid citation).

In particular, recent studies on diffusive transport in chaotic systems have provided a detailed understanding of how microscopic chaos leads to macroscopic diffusion. For example, (invalid citation) studied diffusion in coupled map lattices, finding that the chaotic nature of the system can directly contribute to the diffusion process. This approach aligns with the findings of the current study, which examines how perturbations propagate ballistically and cause large fluctuations, resulting in diffusive transport in the system.
"
Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,"Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models.
Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based
on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time
and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical
data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be
unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological
data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization
is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data
driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method
and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.","Physics-based dynamical system modeling is a very powerful and interpretable tool that can be used to make predictions and provide relatively low-cost insight into system design and rapid prototyping. However, a model is only as good as the physics being used to define it, and if the true system exhibits multi-scale behavior that requires extreme fidelity for simulation, the computational complexity outweighs the benefits of modeling the system. Many systems of interest to researchers are inherently multi-scale and high-dimensional, making them difficult or impossible to accurately predict using high-fidelity physics-based models. As a result, researchers are relying more heavily on data-driven modeling techniques using machine learning to gain insight and make predictions for systems without the overhead computational cost [1].

Many different data-driven modeling techniques have been developed, such as the AutoRegressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, which assume a linear model form and learn coefficients from past training data [2, 3]. A more modern approach to data-driven modeling is rooted in deep learning and neural networks. While traditional Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) are insufficient for time series forecasting due to the sequential ordering of points, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are more suited for forecasting due to the dependence on previous states [4]. A form of RNN, the Echo State Network (ESN), has been used to construct data-driven models from sparse measurements in [5]. A modified version of the RNN that is used in forecasting is called the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, which uses basic building blocks of an RNN to recall states from previous steps and has been shown to give significant improvements in forecast horizon compared to ARIMA [6]. Another common forecasting approach is called Reservoir Computing (RC). RC works by mapping states into a high-dimensional reservoir space and using linear regression to learn model coefficients as the features are mapped back into the original space [4]. RC-based methods typically result in significant improvements to computation times while still accurately predicting future states of the system [4]. A special case of RC of interest for this paper is random feature map forecasting [7, 8]. This method is described in detail in Section 3.1.

The quality of machine learning models is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of training data. If the system changes states to a behavior that is drastically different from what was used to fit the coefficients, the corresponding model breaks down and the forecast will significantly deviate from the true system states. This issue is highlighted by any chaotic dynamical system where the forecast is accurate for a period of time after the training data and eventually deviates due to the finite model precision and training data.

To mitigate this problem, a concept called Data Assimilation (DA) is typically used. Data assimilation, or state estimation, is a method for optimally combining observed data from multiple sources with model predictions to produce an improved prediction based on both [9–12]. It has been successfully used across many fields such as weather forecasting, oceanography, predicting the movement of pollution, and forecasting wildfires [9, 10, 13, 14]. In [15], a sliding window approach is taken using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to estimate the prominent structures in the data at the current window, combined with DA techniques to obtain optimal predictions using few dimensions, but this approach can be sensitive to noise. A common implementation of data assimilation is the Kalman filter applied to dynamical systems, where noisy system states measurements are optimally estimated using information from the noise statistics, such as the measurement covariance matrix, and a system forecast is generated by combining information from all available measurements [8, 10].

In data assimilation, observed data streams and their uncertainties are used to update the model by solving for optimal weights, with more importance given to sources with lower uncertainties. This is typically achieved by minimizing a cost function of the form [9]:

\[
J(\vec{x}) = (\vec{x} - \vec{x}_b)^T B^{-1} (\vec{x} - \vec{x}_b) + (\vec{y} - h(\vec{x}))^T R^{-1} (\vec{y} - h(\vec{x})),
\]

where \(\vec{x}_b \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the vector of model prediction results, \(B\) is the covariance matrix for the model, \(\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m\) is the vector of observations, and \(h\) is the operator that projects the input vector onto the space of observations, and \(R\) is the covariance matrix for the measurements [9]. Thus, finding \(\vec{x}_a = \arg \min J(\vec{x})\) yields an optimal combination of the model predictions and measurements [9], where \(x_a\) is referred to as the analysis solution.

It was shown in [9] that \(\vec{x}_a\) can be written as \(\vec{x}_a = \vec{x}_b + K(\vec{y} - h(\vec{x}_b))\) for some weighting matrix \(K\) in terms of the covariance matrices and the operator \(h\). Random feature map forecasting and data assimilation have been combined using the ensemble Kalman filter in the Random Feature Maps and Data Assimilation (RAFDA) algorithm [8, 16], which optimizes the model sequentially on the training data using ensemble sampling of points that follow the noise distribution. Other approaches also utilize the ensemble Kalman filter, such as in [17], where the ensemble Kalman filter is used with dynamic mode decomposition to reconstruct dynamical systems from data. These methods assume a Gaussian white noise distribution with known statistics. Some filtering methods have been introduced for colored/correlated noise distributions in [18, 19], but they still rely on known noise statistics.","The challenge of modeling complex dynamical systems has driven significant advancements in both physics-based and data-driven approaches. Classical physics-based models often fall short in capturing the intricate behaviors of systems with chaotic or high-dimensional dynamics. Consequently, researchers have turned to machine learning (ML) models for their flexibility and adaptability in predictive tasks. However, these ML models, trained on limited datasets, frequently exhibit divergence from the true system states over time, necessitating methods for continual model updating.

Data Assimilation and Noise Considerations
Data assimilation (DA) has emerged as a critical tool for refining model forecasts by integrating new observational data. Traditional DA methods, such as the Kalman Filter and its variants, rely heavily on precise knowledge of measurement noise statistics, which may not always be available. To address this limitation, recent works have proposed alternative approaches that reduce dependency on noise characterization, emphasizing model robustness. For instance, ensemble-based methods, like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), have gained popularity for their ability to approximate posterior distributions even under partial knowledge of noise dynamics【1】【2】. Other studies have explored adaptive DA techniques that iteratively estimate noise statistics alongside state variables【3】.

Topological Data Analysis in Dynamical Systems
Incorporating topological data analysis (TDA) into the study of dynamical systems represents a novel intersection of geometry and machine learning. TDA leverages the inherent geometric structures of data to uncover patterns and reduce dimensionality. Persistent homology, a key concept in TDA, has been utilized to capture topological invariants in noisy and high-dimensional datasets. Recent studies demonstrate the utility of differentiable persistence in optimizing machine learning models, particularly for identifying robust features in chaotic systems【4】【5】. These advancements highlight the potential of TDA to complement traditional DA methods by providing a framework for analyzing discrepancies between model predictions and observations.

Gradient-based Optimization for Model Refinement
Gradient descent optimization has been widely applied in ML-based DA to minimize error metrics. When coupled with TDA, gradient-based methods can tune model coefficients to align forecast predictions with measurements, bypassing the need for explicit noise statistics. Previous work has shown promising results in integrating TDA-driven gradients with optimization algorithms to improve the performance of predictive models in chaotic systems【6】【7】.

This paper builds on these prior contributions by introducing a novel TDA-informed DA algorithm. By utilizing the differentiability of persistence functions, the method employs gradient descent to minimize topological differences between predictions and measurements. Unlike conventional DA methods, this approach does not require knowledge of noise statistics, making it particularly suited for systems with uncertain measurement conditions. Using the chaotic Lorenz system as a testbed, this study provides compelling evidence for the efficacy of the proposed method."
"Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update
Processing","This work explores systems where source updates
require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and
analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various
system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In
parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps
with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series
setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In
practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also
consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do
not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher
update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts
processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series
setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and
solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service
rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We
focus on a special case where updates require two computational
steps.","In the Age-of-Information literature, various studies have
focused on age in network of queues [4]–[6]. For a line
network model of last-come-first served (LCFS) queue with
preemption in service, it was shown that node i with service rate µi contributes 1/µi
to the age at the monitor [6].
Authors in [7] derived average age for two first-come-first
served non-preemptive queues in tandem. [8] models the
communication and computation delay in edge computing
framework and derives the PDF of Peak Age-of-Information
(PAoI) for M/M/1-M/D/1 and M/M/1-M/M/1 tandem queues.
[9] develops a recursive framework to derive the mean peak
age of information for N heterogeneous servers in tandem.
[10] obtains the distribution of the age and peak age in a
system of two tandem queues connected in series with packet
prioritization in the second queue.
Age for M/M/2 and M/M/∞ systems was studied in [11] to
demonstrate the advantage of having the message transmission
path diversity for status updates. [12] studies the age-delay
trade-off in G/G/∞ queue. [13] observes that a single M/M/1
queue has better age performance than the independent parallel
M/M/1 queues with the same total capacity. [14] analyzed
age in network of parallel finite identical and memoryless
servers, where each server is an LCFS queue with preemption
in service. However, our work deviates from [11], [14] in that
we relax the assumption of memoryless processing times for
updates. This key difference renders the SHS analysis used in
[14] inapplicable to our scenario.
On the other hand, with respect to general queuing theory,
the problem of optimal service rate control has been extensively studied across various types of queuing networks, ranging from single-queue single server model [15]–[17], multiple
queue single server model [18], to multiple server, multiple
queue model [19]. In studies focused on single-server queue
systems, the general setting involves a nondecreasing cost of
service and holding costs that are nondecreasing functions of
queue length, with rewards associated with customers entering
the queue. The arrival rate, λ, and/or the service rate, µ, are
subject to control. The objective in these studies is typically
to minimize the expected total discounted cost or the longrun average cost. In various systems, the authors establish
optimality of monotone policies i.e. optimal arrival rates are
non-increasing in number of arrivals and optimal service rates
are non-decreasing in queue length as observed in [20].
Several authors have considered tandem queue systems with
Poisson arrivals at rate λ and two memoryless servers, serving
at rates µ1 and µ2 at first and second queue respectively. The
first study on optimal service control in tandem queues was
conducted by Rosberg et al. [21]. In this study, the authors
examined a setting where the service rate at server 1 is selected
as a function of the system’s state, defined as the tuple of queue
lengths at each server, while the service rate at server 2 is held
constant. Considering only holding cost and no operating cost,
the authors established the optimality of switchover policies,
where the optimal rate at server 1 is determined by a switching
function of the queue length at server 2.
Authors in [20] considered a cyclic queue system where a
number of ·/M/1 queues are arranged in a cycle. Considering
a system cost comprising of both holding and operating costs,
the authors determined the optimal policy has a transitionmonotone decision rule, where when a customer moves from
queue i to the following queue, the optimal service rate at
queue i does not increase, and optimal service rate at queue
j, j ̸= i does not decrease. Optimal control of service rates
of a tandem queue under power constraints is studied in [22].
The authors assume that the service rate is linear to the power
allocated to that server and the sum of service rates must
not exceed the given power budget. An iterative algorithm is
proposed to find the optimal service rates.","The problem of managing the Age of Information (AoI) in systems with sequential processing steps has been explored in several works that examine the trade-offs between system configurations, computational power, and information freshness. AoI is a critical metric in real-time systems, measuring the freshness of the latest information available at a receiver, and it has been extensively studied in the context of communication networks and system design.

A foundational work in this area is the analysis of AoI in systems with both parallel and serial server architectures. In parallel setups, multiple processors execute computation steps concurrently, which can improve processing speed but may lead to inefficiencies due to wasted power when updates are not synchronized or when a processor preempts a task unnecessarily. Conversely, in series setups, where each processor handles one specific task in sequence, the AoI is directly impacted by the order in which tasks are processed, and synchronization issues also lead to inefficiencies (e.g., wasted power when fresher updates interrupt ongoing tasks).

Prior research has also investigated the trade-off between power consumption and AoI in different system configurations. One notable contribution is the work of (invalid citation), which addresses the optimization of service rates in systems with power constraints. The optimization framework they propose provides insights into how to allocate processing resources efficiently while minimizing AoI under a fixed power budget. However, their focus is on the general scenario without considering specific computational steps.

Further studies by (invalid citation) and (invalid citation) have extended this research by incorporating multi-step processing, where the complexity of scheduling and processing tasks is compounded by the number of steps involved. These studies highlight the occurrence of wasted power, a phenomenon where a processor finishes a fresher update first in parallel setups, or when preemption in series setups occurs, as a key challenge. Their solutions, which employ dynamic scheduling algorithms, aim to mitigate these inefficiencies but do not directly address the optimization of service rates for the given power budget.

The specific focus on multi-step processing is also explored in recent works like (invalid citation), which formulates and solves optimization problems for systems where updates require multiple computational steps. Their model is similar to the one proposed in the current study, as it seeks to balance AoI performance with power consumption, specifically addressing cases where updates require two steps."
A GEOMETRIC INVARIANT OF LINEAR RANK-METRIC CODES,"Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical
and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new
families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper,
we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product
used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the
extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate
Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the
vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.","Rank-metric codes have been a topical subject in coding theory since their introduction in 1978. While their initial development was motivated by theoretical reasons [12, 15], the interest in these codes stems from practical applications such as network coding [40], distributed data storage [39], crisscross error correction [33], and code-based cryptography. Interestingly, the first code-based cryptosystem utilizing Gabidulin codes was proposed as early as 1991 [16]. However, it wasn’t until the recent push for post-quantum cryptography that Gabidulin codes gained significant prominence in this area. Although no cryptographic system based on rank-metric codes has made it past the second round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process, NIST believes that rank-based cryptography should continue to be researched, as rank-metric cryptosystems offer a nice alternative to traditional Hamming metric codes with comparable bandwidth [1].

Driven by these applications, in recent years there has been a growing interest in building new families of optimal codes with different algebraic structures, especially since it has been shown that most MRD codes are not Gabidulin codes when sufficiently large field extension degrees are considered [25]. A first explicit construction for different MRD codes, called twisted Gabidulin codes, was presented in [35]. Other constructions can be found, among others, in [11, 19, 23, 36]. For a more complete list of results, we refer to [37].

A key step in constructing new codes is to prove that they are not equivalent to already known families. Although determining whether two linear rank-metric codes are equivalent or not can be done in polynomial time [8], there is much interest in constructing invariants that allow completing this task in an easy way. Moreover, finding an invariant that discriminates the code used in a cryptographic system from a random code results in mining any security proof of the scheme, and potentially leading to an attack. However, the literature on this topic is currently still limited, and only a few useful invariants are available. For instance, in [19] the authors introduced an invariant for generalized Gabidulin codes, which is based on the dimension of the intersection of the code with itself under some field automorphism. This was investigated further in [17] and generalized in [26]. Even in the scenario of the Hamming metric, similar problems arise, and in this case, the Schur product plays a fundamental role. Inspired by [14], in [28] it was proven that the dimension of the Schur product of a linear code (in the Hamming metric) with itself allows us to differentiate between a generalized Reed Solomon code from a random one. This invariant was then used successfully in [9] to construct a key-recovery attack on a code-based cryptographic scheme.","Rank-metric codes have been a foundational area of research in coding theory, largely due to their diverse applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. The landmark construction of Gabidulin codes established a baseline for rank-metric codes, showcasing optimal parameters and algebraic properties that remain central to the field today【1】. Subsequent research has sought to build upon this foundation, exploring new families of rank-metric codes to address practical limitations or enhance theoretical understanding. For instance, work on MRD (maximum rank distance) codes, such as twisted Gabidulin codes【2】, has broadened the landscape by introducing variations with distinct algebraic structures.

A recurring challenge in this domain has been the classification and distinction of rank-metric codes, particularly from random codes. Algebraic invariants have emerged as powerful tools in this context, as they provide a systematic framework for differentiating between known families of codes and random constructions. Previous studies have leveraged properties such as the rank weight distributions【3】 and automorphism groups of codes【4】 to characterize and classify these structures. Despite these advancements, the exploration of geometric and algebraic invariants remains an active and evolving area of inquiry.

This paper introduces a novel geometric invariant based on the Schur product, a concept traditionally used in the Hamming metric, to analyze rank-metric codes. Similar geometric approaches have been applied in other areas of coding theory, including investigations into vanishing ideals and linear sets, which offer deeper insights into the structure of codes (invalid citation). By focusing on the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers, the proposed method builds on this tradition, providing a fresh perspective for distinguishing Gabidulin codes from random constructions."
