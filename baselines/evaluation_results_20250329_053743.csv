        Source Paper Abstract:
        Large Language Models have shown impressive per-
formance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured
and unstructured textual data. More recently, adaptions of these
models have drawn attention to their abilities to work with code
across different programming languages. On this notion, different
benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest
that certain models have programming abilities comparable
to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate
that the performance on this benchmark does not translate
to the innate ability of humans to appreciate the structural
control flow of code.
For this purpose, we extract code solutions from the Hu-
manEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform very
strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Code execution is a fundamental aspect of programming language semantics that
reflects the exact behavior of the code. However, most pre-trained models for
code intelligence ignore the execution trace and only rely on source code and
syntactic structures. In this paper, we investigate how well pre-trained models
can understand and perform code execution. We develop a mutation-based data
augmentation technique to create a large-scale and realistic Python dataset and
task for code execution, which challenges existing models such as Codex. We
then present CodeExecutor, a Transformer model that leverages code execution
pre-training and curriculum learning to enhance its semantic comprehension. We
evaluate CodeExecutor on code execution and show its promising performance and
limitations. We also demonstrate its potential benefits for code intelligence
tasks such as zero-shot code-to-code search and text-to-code generation. Our
analysis provides insights into the learning and generalization abilities of
pre-trained models for code execution.

    In recent years, the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in code generation and understanding have been a focal point of research, with significant advancements being made in their ability to handle both static and dynamic aspects of programming languages. Liu et al. (2023) explore the limitations of pre-trained models in understanding code execution by introducing CodeExecutor, a model that leverages code execution pre-training and curriculum learning to enhance semantic comprehension. Their work highlights the importance of execution traces in improving code intelligence tasks, which aligns with our focus on evaluating LLMs' ability to trace execution paths in code [1].

Similarly, Armengol-Estapé et al. (2025) emphasize the significance of execution traces in training LLMs, proposing Execution Tuning (E.T.) as a method to incorporate real-world program execution traces into model training. Their findings demonstrate the advantages of dynamic scratchpads for handling long execution sequences, which is pertinent to our investigation of LLMs' performance on extended execution traces [3]. Both studies underscore the necessity of integrating dynamic execution information to enhance the models' understanding of code behavior, a theme central to our research.

Another line of research focuses on improving code reasoning through multimodal approaches. Le et al. (2024) introduce VisualCoder, which combines multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning with visual Control Flow Graphs to provide deeper insights into code execution flows. This approach addresses the challenges of aligning code snippets with their execution paths, thereby enhancing program behavior prediction and error detection [2]. Our work similarly seeks to evaluate the structural understanding of code by LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios involving recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming.

In the realm of semantic understanding, Ma et al. (2023) propose the Semantic Chain-of-Thought (SeCoT) approach, which integrates semantic information such as data flow and control flow into LLMs to improve code generation accuracy. By leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs for in-context learning, SeCoT automates the process of semantic feature extraction, which is crucial for bridging the gap between natural language requirements and code generation [4]. This approach resonates with our goal of assessing LLMs' ability to navigate and understand advanced structural components in code.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which specifically evaluates LLMs' ability to trace execution paths in code, including advanced structural components not extensively covered in existing benchmarks. By focusing on the structural control flow of code, our work aims to highlight the current limitations of LLMs in code reasoning and provide a dataset that can aid researchers in addressing these challenges. We hope that our findings will contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance the semantic and dynamic understanding of code by LLMs, ultimately bridging the gap between human-like code reasoning and machine capabilities.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Predicting program behavior and reasoning about code execution remain
significant challenges in software engineering, particularly for large language
models (LLMs) designed for code analysis. While these models excel at
understanding static syntax, they often struggle with dynamic reasoning tasks.
We introduce VisualCoder, a simple yet effective approach that enhances code
reasoning by integrating multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a
visual Control Flow Graph (CFG). By aligning code snippets with their
corresponding CFGs, VisualCoder provides deeper insights into execution flows.
We address challenges in multimodal CoT integration through a reference
mechanism, ensuring consistency between code and its execution path, thereby
improving performance in program behavior prediction, error detection, and
output generation.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Code generation and understanding are critical capabilities for large
language models (LLMs). Thus, most LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned on code
data. However, these datasets typically treat code as static strings and rarely
exploit the dynamic information about their execution. Building upon previous
work on trace modeling, we study Execution Tuning (E.T.), a training procedure
in which we explicitly model real-world program execution traces without
requiring manual test annotations. We train and evaluate models on different
execution trace granularities (line and instruction-level) and strategies on
the task of output prediction, obtaining around 80% accuracy on CruxEval and
MBPP, and showing the advantages of dynamic scratchpads (i.e., self-contained
intermediate computations updated by the model rather than accumulated as a
history of past computations) on long executions (up to 14k steps). Finally, we
discuss E.T.'s practical applications.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        Large Language Models have shown impressive per-
formance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured
and unstructured textual data. More recently, adaptions of these
models have drawn attention to their abilities to work with code
across different programming languages. On this notion, different
benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest
that certain models have programming abilities comparable
to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate
that the performance on this benchmark does not translate
to the innate ability of humans to appreciate the structural
control flow of code.
For this purpose, we extract code solutions from the Hu-
manEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform very
strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls
sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we
investigate the ability of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs to match the
execution trace and find that, despite the model’s abilities to
generate semantically identical code, they possess only limited
ability to trace the execution path, especially for traces with
increased length. We find that even the top-performing model,
Gemini 1.5 Pro can only fully correctly generate the trace of
47% of HumanEval tasks.
In addition, we introduce a specific subset for three key
structures not, or only contained to a limited extent in Hu-
manEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object Oriented
Programming principles, including concepts like Inheritance
and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the
investigated models achieve an average accuracy of over 5%
on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with
the ubiquitous HumanEval tasks, we present the Benchmark
CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding
and Testing, which measures a models ability to trace the execu-
tion of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural
components. We conclude that the current generation LLMs still
need to significantly improve to enhance their code reasoning
abilities. We hope our dataset can help researchers bridge this
gap in the near future.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in code
generation. However, automated code generation is still challenging since it
requires a high-level semantic mapping between natural language requirements
and codes. Most existing LLMs-based approaches for code generation rely on
decoder-only causal language models often treate codes merely as plain text
tokens, i.e., feeding the requirements as a prompt input, and outputing code as
flat sequence of tokens, potentially missing the rich semantic features
inherent in source code. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the ""Semantic
Chain-of-Thought"" approach to intruduce semantic information of code, named
SeCoT. Our motivation is that the semantic information of the source code (\eg
data flow and control flow) describes more precise program execution behavior,
intention and function. By guiding LLM consider and integrate semantic
information, we can achieve a more granular understanding and representation of
code, enhancing code generation accuracy. Meanwhile, while traditional
techniques leveraging such semantic information require complex static or
dynamic code analysis to obtain features such as data flow and control flow,
SeCoT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic
capabilities of LLMs (i.e., in-context learning), while being generalizable and
applicable to challenging domains. While SeCoT can be applied with different
LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: ChatGPT(close-source
model) and WizardCoder(open-source model). The experimental study on three
popular DL benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, HumanEval-ET and MBPP) shows that SeCoT
can achieves state-of-the-art performance, greatly improving the potential for
large models and code generation.

model evaluations from developers must be taken at face value. These benchmark
results-whether over task accuracy, bias evaluations, or safety checks-are
traditionally impossible to verify by a model end-user without the costly or
impossible process of re-performing the benchmark on black-box model outputs.
This work presents a method of verifiable model evaluation using model
inference through zkSNARKs. The resulting zero-knowledge computational proofs
of model outputs over datasets can be packaged into verifiable evaluation
attestations showing that models with fixed private weights achieve stated
performance or fairness metrics over public inputs. We present a flexible
proving system that enables verifiable attestations to be performed on any
standard neural network model with varying compute requirements. For the first
time, we demonstrate this across a sample of real-world models and highlight
key challenges and design solutions. This presents a new transparency paradigm

    The intersection of machine learning (ML) and privacy has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly with the advent of techniques that ensure privacy during model inference. A prominent approach in this domain is the use of zero-knowledge proofs, such as zkSNARKs, to provide verifiable evaluations of ML models. South et al. (2024) explore this concept by presenting a method for verifiable model evaluation using zkSNARKs, which allows model outputs to be verified without revealing the underlying model parameters. Their work focuses on creating zero-knowledge computational proofs that can be used to attest to the performance and fairness of models with private weights over public inputs. This approach introduces a new transparency paradigm, enabling end-users to trust model evaluations without needing access to the model itself (South et al., 2024).

The use of zkSNARKs in ML has primarily been directed towards ensuring the integrity and verifiability of model outputs, as demonstrated by South et al. (2024). However, the privacy of model parameters during inference remains an underexplored area. While South et al. provide a framework for verifying model outputs, they do not address the selective revelation of model sections, which is crucial for maintaining privacy in distributed ML environments. This gap highlights the need for solutions that not only verify model outputs but also protect the privacy of model parameters during inference, especially in scenarios involving distributed nodes with varying trust levels.

Our research builds upon the foundational work of South et al. by extending the application of zkSNARKs to enable partial privacy of model parameters during distributed ML inference. Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on output verification, our solution allows model providers to selectively reveal model sections, ensuring both verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a customizable set of trusted and untrusted nodes. This selective revelation is particularly beneficial in distributed environments, such as ML edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned models, where privacy and trust among participants are paramount. By addressing the scalability challenges associated with proving and setup operations, our work paves the way for practical implementations of privacy-preserving inference in larger models.

In summary, while existing research has laid the groundwork for verifiable model evaluations using zkSNARKs, our work addresses the critical need for privacy of model parameters during inference. By enabling selective revelation of model sections, we provide a novel approach that enhances trust and privacy in distributed ML environments. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, highlighting minimal inference overhead and identifying areas for future optimization. This contribution not only advances the field of privacy-preserving ML but also opens new avenues for deploying secure and trustworthy ML models in diverse applications.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        The Transformer architecture is widely regarded as the most powerful tool for natural language processing, but due to the high number of complex operations, it inherently faces the issue of extensive energy consumption. To address this issue, we consider spiking neural networks (SNN), an energy-efficient alternative to common artificial neural networks (ANN) due to their naturally event-driven way of processing information. However, this inherently makes them difficult to train, which is why many SNN-related models circumvent this issue through the conversion of pre-trained ANN networks. More recently, attempts have been made to create directly trained SNN-based adaptions of the Transformer model structure. While the results showed great promise, their sole application field was computer vision and based on incorporating encoder blocks. In this paper, we propose SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, for application on the field of natural language processing. We further analyze the impact of exchanging different blocks of the ANN model with their spike-based alternatives to identify pain points and significant sources of performance loss. Similarly, we extend our investigation to the role of residual connections and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques. Besides the work on the model architecture, we formulate and compare different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the spiking decoder block reduces the theoretical energy consumption by 87 to 93 percent compared to the power required for a regular encoder block.

placing technological challenges for generalization. This work proposes the
first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both
discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes with {0,1}
levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional,
elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the
addition nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by
direction and amplitude information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control
spike firing rate is well designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism
in language modeling, named SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general
language tasks with fully spike-driven models, which achieve much higher
accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also greatly bridges the performance
gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling. Our code is available at

    Source Abstract:
    The Transformer architecture is widely regarded as the most powerful tool for natural language processing, but due to the high number of complex operations, it inherently faces the issue of extensive energy consumption. To address this issue, we consider spiking neural networks (SNN), an energy-efficient alternative to common artificial neural networks (ANN) due to their naturally event-driven way of processing information. However, this inherently makes them difficult to train, which is why many SNN-related models circumvent this issue through the conversion of pre-trained ANN networks. More recently, attempts have been made to create directly trained SNN-based adaptions of the Transformer model structure. While the results showed great promise, their sole application field was computer vision and based on incorporating encoder blocks. In this paper, we propose SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, for application on the field of natural language processing. We further analyze the impact of exchanging different blocks of the ANN model with their spike-based alternatives to identify pain points and significant sources of performance loss. Similarly, we extend our investigation to the role of residual connections and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques. Besides the work on the model architecture, we formulate and compare different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range. Finally, it will be demonstrated that the spiking decoder block reduces the theoretical energy consumption by 87 to 93 percent compared to the power required for a regular encoder block.

Xingrun Xing et al.

The authors highlight the challenges associated with encoding text into spike trains, a critical step for integrating NLP tasks into the neuromorphic setting. By comparing various text encoding methods, they propose a novel approach that surpasses the traditional Poisson rate-coding technique, achieving a 13% improvement in benchmark NLP tasks. Their findings underscore the substantial energy savings of SNNs over conventional deep neural networks, with a reported 32x increase in energy efficiency during inference and 60x during training. This work not only reinforces the viability of SNNs in NLP but also provides practical insights into optimizing text encoding for spike-based models (Knipper et al., 2024).

Both of these studies underscore the growing interest in leveraging the energy-efficient properties of SNNs for NLP applications. While Xing et al. (2024) focus on enhancing the semantic encoding capabilities of spikes, Knipper et al. (2024) address the practical challenges of text-to-spike conversion and demonstrate the energy benefits of SNNs. These complementary approaches highlight the multifaceted nature of integrating SNNs into NLP, from theoretical advancements in spike encoding to practical implementations in energy-efficient computing.

        As spiking neural networks receive more attention, we look toward
applications of this computing paradigm in fields other than computer vision
and signal processing. One major field, underexplored in the neuromorphic
setting, is Natural Language Processing (NLP), where most state-of-the-art
solutions still heavily rely on resource-consuming and power-hungry traditional
deep learning architectures. Therefore, it is compelling to design NLP models
for neuromorphic architectures due to their low energy requirements, with the
additional benefit of a more human-brain-like operating model for processing
information. However, one of the biggest issues with bringing NLP to the
neuromorphic setting is in properly encoding text into a spike train so that it
can be seamlessly handled by both current and future SNN architectures. In this
paper, we compare various methods of encoding text as spikes and assess each
method's performance in an associated SNN on a downstream NLP task, namely,
sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we go on to propose a new method of encoding
text as spikes that outperforms a widely-used rate-coding technique, Poisson
rate-coding, by around 13\% on our benchmark NLP tasks. Subsequently, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of SNNs implemented in hardware for the
sentiment analysis task compared to traditional deep neural networks, observing
an energy efficiency increase of more than 32x during inference and 60x during
training while incurring the expected energy-performance tradeoff.

with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches
harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first

        The success of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous
successful experiences, researchers have recently explored
extending the success to the video understanding realms.
Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream
approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning
with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches
harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first
make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and
identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack
of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further
investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples,
which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity.
Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid
to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction
diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves
performance comparable to or even superior to using full
video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size.
Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost
the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark

        The exploration of multimodal language models integrates multiple data types,
such as images, text, language, audio, and other heterogeneity. While the
latest large language models excel in text-based tasks, they often struggle to
understand and process other data types. Multimodal models address this
limitation by combining various modalities, enabling a more comprehensive
understanding of diverse data. This paper begins by defining the concept of
multimodal and examining the historical development of multimodal algorithms.
Furthermore, we introduce a range of multimodal products, focusing on the
efforts of major technology companies. A practical guide is provided, offering
insights into the technical aspects of multimodal models. Moreover, we present
a compilation of the latest algorithms and commonly used datasets, providing
researchers with valuable resources for experimentation and evaluation. Lastly,
we explore the applications of multimodal models and discuss the challenges
associated with their development. By addressing these aspects, this paper aims
to facilitate a deeper understanding of multimodal models and their potential
in various domains.

        Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

        Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information
across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are
now involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice,
but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and
what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to
bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future
of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which
models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary
perspectives. The AI Thinking model addresses five practice-based competencies
involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use in information processes,
formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting
appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used
in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI
Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader
cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing
discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help
to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI use,
and to reshape the future of AI in practice.

    In recent years, the exploration of human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence has gained significant attention, with various frameworks proposed to enhance AI's cognitive capabilities. One such approach is AI Thinking, introduced by Denis Newman-Griffis (2024), which emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary perspectives in AI application. AI Thinking provides a conceptual framework that models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across different contexts, focusing on competencies such as motivating AI use, formulating methods, and situating AI within sociotechnical environments. This framework highlights the necessity of bridging divides between academic disciplines to reshape AI's future in practice. While AI Thinking primarily addresses the practical application of AI, it underscores the importance of structured reasoning processes, which align with the goals of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework. By augmenting datasets with structured forward-backward reasoning, REVTHINK aims to enhance reasoning performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby contributing to the broader discourse on AI literacy and innovation.

Another significant contribution to the field is the introduction of lateral thinking in AI systems, as discussed by Stefan Dernbach et al. (2024) in their work on Streaming Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT). SALT is a multi-agent framework designed to implement System-2 reasoning capabilities, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under uncertainty. The framework leverages lateral information flow across agent interactions to enhance reasoning in complex, low-specificity queries within streaming data environments. This approach to reasoning, which emphasizes dynamic communication and belief management, shares thematic similarities with REVTHINK's focus on reverse thinking. Both frameworks aim to enrich the reasoning capabilities of AI systems by incorporating diverse thinking processes, whether through lateral or reverse reasoning. The insights from SALT's multi-agent approach provide valuable context for understanding how structured reasoning can be systematically integrated into AI models, further supporting the objectives of REVTHINK.

In the realm of imitation learning, Shengran Hu and Jeff Clune (2023) propose Thought Cloning, a framework that trains AI agents to think like humans by imitating human thoughts alongside behaviors. Thought Cloning emphasizes the role of language in human thinking, aiming to improve AI agents' generalization, exploration, and adaptability. By observing and replicating human thought processes, Thought Cloning enhances AI safety and interpretability, allowing for better debugging and steering of agents. This approach resonates with the goals of REVTHINK, which seeks to enable LLMs to perform reverse thinking by training them on structured reasoning tasks. Both Thought Cloning and REVTHINK highlight the importance of integrating human-like cognitive processes into AI systems to improve their performance and generalization capabilities, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

In summary, the exploration of human-like reasoning in AI, as demonstrated by AI Thinking, SALT, and Thought Cloning, provides a rich context for the development of frameworks like REVTHINK. Our work builds upon these foundational ideas by introducing a novel approach to reverse thinking in LLMs, leveraging structured reasoning tasks to enhance performance and generalization. By situating REVTHINK within the broader discourse on AI reasoning, we contribute to the ongoing efforts to create more powerful, efficient, and human-like AI systems. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning tasks across various domains, showcasing the potential of reverse thinking to reshape AI's cognitive capabilities and its application in diverse contexts.

        Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human
reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a
problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start
from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between
their forward and backward thinking. To enable
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced
Thinking (REVTHINK), a framework composed of
data augmentation and learning objectives. In REVTHINK, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher
model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2)
forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4)
backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task
learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning
from a question, (b) generate a backward question
from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments
across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math,
and logical reasoning show an average 13.53%
improvement over the student model’s zero-shot
performance and a 6.84% improvement over the
strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency
– using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning
from the training data, it outperforms a standard
fine-tuning method trained on 10× more forward
reasoning. REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.

capabilities in AI systems, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under
uncertainty. We present a framework for systematic generation and modeling of
lateral thinking queries and evaluation datasets. We introduce Streaming
Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT), a multi-agent framework designed to process
complex, low-specificity queries in streaming data environments. SALT
implements lateral thinking-inspired System-2 reasoning through a dynamic
communication structure between specialized agents. Our key insight is that
lateral information flow across long-distance agent interactions, combined with
fine-grained belief management, yields richer information contexts and enhanced
reasoning. Preliminary quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate SALT's
potential to outperform single-agent systems in handling complex lateral
reasoning tasks in a streaming environment.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Language is often considered a key aspect of human thinking, providing us
with exceptional abilities to generalize, explore, plan, replan, and adapt to
new situations. However, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are far from
human-level performance in any of these abilities. We hypothesize one reason
for such cognitive deficiencies is that they lack the benefits of thinking in
language and that we can improve AI agents by training them to think like
humans do. We introduce a novel Imitation Learning framework, Thought Cloning,
where the idea is to not just clone the behaviors of human demonstrators, but
also the thoughts humans have as they perform these behaviors. While we expect
Thought Cloning to truly shine at scale on internet-sized datasets of humans
thinking out loud while acting (e.g. online videos with transcripts), here we
conduct experiments in a domain where the thinking and action data are
synthetically generated. Results reveal that Thought Cloning learns much faster
than Behavioral Cloning and its performance advantage grows the further out of
distribution test tasks are, highlighting its ability to better handle novel
situations. Thought Cloning also provides important benefits for AI Safety and
Interpretability, and makes it easier to debug and improve AI. Because we can
observe the agent's thoughts, we can (1) more easily diagnose why things are
going wrong, making it easier to fix the problem, (2) steer the agent by
correcting its thinking, or (3) prevent it from doing unsafe things it plans to
do. Overall, by training agents how to think as well as behave, Thought Cloning
creates safer, more powerful agents.

        This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The commitment power of senders distinguishes Bayesian persuasion problems
from other games with (strategic) communication. Persuasion games with multiple
senders have largely studied simultaneous commitment and signalling settings.
However, many real-world instances with multiple senders have sequential
signalling. In such contexts, commitments can also be made sequentially, and
then the order of commitment by the senders -- the sender signalling last
committing first or last -- could significantly impact the equilibrium payoffs
and strategies. For a two-sender persuasion game where the senders are
partially aware of the state of the world, we find necessary and sufficient
conditions to determine when different commitment orders yield different payoff
profiles. In particular, for the two-sender setting, we show that different
payoff profiles arise if two properties hold: 1) the two senders are willing to
collaborate in persuading the receiver in some state(s); and 2) the sender
signalling second can carry out a credible threat when committing first such
that the other sender's room to design signals gets constrained.

    In the realm of Bayesian persuasion, the concept of commitment power plays a pivotal role in shaping the strategic interactions between senders and receivers. The work by Shih-Tang Su and Vijay G. Subramanian (2022) delves into the dynamics of commitment in scenarios involving multiple senders, particularly focusing on the order of commitments in sequential signaling settings.

This exploration of commitment order is relevant to our study, as it underscores the importance of strategic commitment in enhancing the sender's payoff, a theme central to our investigation of money-burning tactics in mediated communication [Su & Subramanian, 2022].

Another significant contribution to the literature on Bayesian persuasion is the study by Itai Arieli, Yakov Babichenko, and Fedor Sandomirskiy (2022), which examines the role of mediators in the communication process. Their work characterizes the sender's optimal value in the presence of mediators and reveals that while a single mediator does not benefit the sender, the introduction of a second mediator can enhance the sender's value. This finding is particularly intriguing as it suggests that the structure of the communication channel can impact the effectiveness of persuasion strategies. Our research extends this line of inquiry by introducing money-burning as a mechanism within the communication model, thereby offering a novel approach to enhancing commitment power in mediated settings [Arieli et al., 2022].

The exploration of multi-channel communication structures by Yakov Babichenko, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Haifeng Xu, and Konstantin Zabarnyi (2021) further enriches the discourse on Bayesian persuasion. Their study provides a comprehensive characterization of when one communication structure is superior to another, based on the concept of information dominance among receivers. This work is particularly relevant to our research as it highlights the complexity and strategic considerations involved in designing effective communication mechanisms. By incorporating money-burning tactics, our model adds an additional layer of strategic depth, allowing the sender to leverage commitment power more effectively across different communication channels [Babichenko et al., 2021].

In the context of mediated communication without commitment power, the study by Itai Arieli, Ivan Geffner, and Moshe Tennenholtz (2022) investigates the design of cheap talk mechanisms involving multiple informed senders and a receiver. Their research characterizes the set of implementable action distributions and provides algorithms for computing optimal equilibria. This work complements our study by highlighting the challenges and opportunities in designing communication mechanisms that can achieve desired outcomes even in the absence of commitment power. Our research builds on these insights by demonstrating how money-burning can serve as a commitment device, thereby enhancing the sender's ability to influence the receiver's actions [Arieli et al., 2022].

In summary, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on Bayesian persuasion by introducing a novel approach that integrates money-burning tactics into mediated communication models. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff and demonstrating the effectiveness of money-burning in enhancing commitment power, our work offers new insights into the strategic design of communication mechanisms. Furthermore, our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities underscores its relevance in contemporary digital contexts, where commitment and trust are increasingly critical. Through this exploration, we aim to advance the understanding of how strategic communication can be optimized to achieve desired outcomes in complex, mediated environments.

        This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        An informed sender communicates with an uninformed receiver through a
sequence of uninformed mediators; agents' utilities depend on receiver's action
and the state. For any number of mediators, the sender's optimal value is
characterized. For one mediator, the characterization has a geometric meaning
of constrained concavification of sender's utility, optimal persuasion requires
the same number of signals as without mediators, and the presence of the
mediator is never profitable for the sender. Surprisingly, the second mediator
may improve the value but optimal persuasion may require more signals.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The celebrated Bayesian persuasion model considers strategic communication
between an informed agent (the sender) and uninformed decision makers (the
receivers). The current rapidly-growing literature mostly assumes a dichotomy:
either the sender is powerful enough to communicate separately with each
receiver (a.k.a. private persuasion), or she cannot communicate separately at
all (a.k.a. public persuasion). We study a model that smoothly interpolates
between the two, by considering a natural multi-channel communication structure
in which each receiver observes a subset of the sender's communication
channels. This captures, e.g., receivers on a network, where information
spillover is almost inevitable.
  We completely characterize when one communication structure is better for the
sender than another, in the sense of yielding higher optimal expected utility
universally over all prior distributions and utility functions. The
characterization is based on a simple pairwise relation among receivers - one
receiver information-dominates another if he observes at least the same
channels. We prove that a communication structure $M_1$ is (weakly) better than
$M_2$ if and only if every information-dominating pair of receivers in $M_1$ is
also such in $M_2$. We also provide an additive FPTAS for the optimal sender's
signaling scheme when the number of states is constant and the graph of
information-dominating pairs is a directed forest. Finally, we prove that
finding an optimal signaling scheme under multi-channel persuasion is,
generally, computationally harder than under both public and private
persuasion.

        We study an information design problem with two informed senders and a
receiver in which, in contrast to traditional Bayesian persuasion settings,
senders do not have commitment power. In our setting, a trusted
mediator/platform gathers data from the senders and recommends the receiver
which action to play. We characterize the set of implementable action
distributions that can be obtained in equilibrium, and provide an $O(n \log n)$
algorithm (where $n$ is the number of states) that computes the optimal
equilibrium for the senders. Additionally, we show that the optimal equilibrium
for the receiver can be obtained by a simple revelation mechanism.

    This paper explores the problem of mediated communication enhanced by moneyburning tactics for commitment power. In our model, the sender has state-independent
preferences and can design a communication mechanism that both transmits messages
and burns money. We characterize the sender’s maximum equilibrium payoff, which has
clear geometric interpretations and is linked to two types of robust Bayesian persuasion.
We demonstrate that, generically, the money-burning tactic strictly improves the sender’s
payoff for almost all prior beliefs where commitment is valuable for the sender. Furthermore, our communication model directly applies to Web 3.0 communities, clarifying the
commitment value within these contexts.

    In the realm of Bayesian persuasion, the concept of commitment power plays a pivotal role in shaping the strategic interactions between senders and receivers. The work by Shih-Tang Su and Vijay G. Subramanian (2022) delves into the dynamics of commitment in scenarios involving multiple senders, particularly focusing on the order of commitments in sequential signaling settings. Their research highlights how the sequence in which commitments are made can significantly influence equilibrium payoffs and strategies, especially when senders possess partial information about the state of the world. This exploration of commitment order is relevant to our study, as it underscores the importance of strategic commitment in enhancing the sender's payoff, a theme central to our investigation of money-burning tactics in mediated communication [Su & Subramanian, 2022].

Another significant contribution to the literature on Bayesian persuasion is the study by Itai Arieli, Yakov Babichenko, and Fedor Sandomirskiy (2022), which examines the role of mediators in the communication process. Their work characterizes the sender's optimal value in the presence of mediators and reveals that while a single mediator does not benefit the sender, the introduction of a second mediator can enhance the sender's value. This finding is particularly intriguing as it suggests that the structure of the communication channel can impact the effectiveness of persuasion strategies. Our research extends this line of inquiry by introducing money-burning as a mechanism within the communication model, thereby offering a novel approach to enhancing commitment power in mediated settings [Arieli et al., 2022].

The exploration of multi-channel communication structures by Yakov Babichenko, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Haifeng Xu, and Konstantin Zabarnyi (2021) further enriches the discourse on Bayesian persuasion. Their study provides a comprehensive characterization of when one communication structure is superior to another, based on the concept of information dominance among receivers. This work is particularly relevant to our research as it highlights the complexity and strategic considerations involved in designing effective communication mechanisms. By incorporating money-burning tactics, our model adds an additional layer of strategic depth, allowing the sender to leverage commitment power more effectively across different communication channels [Babichenko et al., 2021].

In the context of mediated communication without commitment power, the study by Itai Arieli, Ivan Geffner, and Moshe Tennenholtz (2022) investigates the design of cheap talk mechanisms involving multiple informed senders and a receiver. Their research characterizes the set of implementable action distributions and provides algorithms for computing optimal equilibria. This work complements our study by highlighting the challenges and opportunities in designing communication mechanisms that can achieve desired outcomes even in the absence of commitment power. Our research builds on these insights by demonstrating how money-burning can serve as a commitment device, thereby enhancing the sender's ability to influence the receiver's actions [Arieli et al., 2022].

In summary, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on Bayesian persuasion by introducing a novel approach that integrates money-burning tactics into mediated communication models. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff and demonstrating the effectiveness of money-burning in enhancing commitment power, our work offers new insights into the strategic design of communication mechanisms. Furthermore, our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities underscores its relevance in contemporary digital contexts, where commitment and trust are increasingly critical. Through this exploration, we aim to advance the understanding of how strategic communication can be optimized to achieve desired outcomes in complex, mediated environments.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Nanson's and Baldwin's voting rules select a winner by successively
eliminating candidates with low Borda scores. We show that these rules have a
number of desirable computational properties. In particular, with unweighted
votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with one manipulator, whilst
with weighted votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with a small
number of candidates and a coalition of manipulators. As only a couple of other
voting rules are known to be NP-hard to manipulate with a single manipulator,
Nanson's and Baldwin's rules appear to be particularly resistant to
manipulation from a theoretical perspective. We also propose a number of
approximation methods for manipulating these two rules. Experiments demonstrate
that both rules are often difficult to manipulate in practice. These results
suggest that elimination style voting rules deserve further study.

    In the realm of social choice theory, the study of voting rules and their susceptibility to various paradoxes has been a topic of significant interest. A key focus has been on Condorcet-consistent rules, which aim to select a candidate that would win in all pairwise majority comparisons. The exploration of these rules often intersects with the investigation of their computational properties and vulnerabilities to manipulation and paradoxes. Narodytska et al. (2011) delve into the manipulation of Nanson's and Baldwin's rules, highlighting their resistance to manipulation due to their NP-hardness in certain scenarios. This resistance is particularly relevant when considering the robustness of voting rules against strategic behavior, a theme that resonates with the examination of Condorcet extensions in our study, especially in the context of the reinforcement paradox.

Another critical aspect of voting rules is their interaction with the no-show paradox, where a voter's participation can lead to a less favorable outcome. Brandt et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive analysis of this paradox, leveraging SAT solving to refine the bounds established by Moulin (1988b). Their work demonstrates the incompatibility between Condorcet-consistency and participation, offering insights into the conditions under which these properties can coexist. This exploration is directly pertinent to our investigation, as we establish that refinements of maximin are immune to the no-show paradox in three-candidate elections, thereby contributing to the discourse on the optimal design of voting rules that balance Condorcet-consistency and participation.

The concept of distance rationalizability, as explored by Elkind et al. (2010), offers another perspective on Condorcet-consistent rules. By viewing voters' preferences as approximations to a consensus, this approach rationalizes voting rules through the lens of distance metrics. Their work on Young's rule and Maximin rule, using distances akin to the Hamming distance, underscores the complexity of winner determination problems in these contexts. This notion of rationalizability aligns with our axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, as we highlight their suitability for three-candidate elections and their immunity to certain paradoxes.

In summary, the existing literature provides a rich tapestry of insights into the computational and theoretical properties of voting rules, particularly those that are Condorcet-consistent. Our research builds upon these foundations by focusing on the specific case of three-candidate elections, offering new characterizations and demonstrating the immunity of certain refinements of maximin to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes. By contextualizing our findings within the broader discourse on voting rules, we contribute to the ongoing effort to design robust and fair mechanisms for collective decision-making.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Voting rules allow multiple agents to aggregate their preferences in order to
reach joint decisions. Perhaps one of the most important desirable properties
in this context is Condorcet-consistency, which requires that a voting rule
should return an alternative that is preferred to any other alternative by some
majority of voters. Another desirable property is participation, which requires
that no voter should be worse off by joining an electorate. A seminal result in
social choice theory by Moulin (1998) has shown that Condorcet-consistency and
participation are incompatible whenever there are at least 4 alternatives and
25 voters. We leverage SAT solving to obtain an elegant human-readable proof of
Moulin's result that requires only 12 voters. Moreover, the SAT solver is able
to construct a Condorcet-consistent voting rule that satisfies participation as
well as a number of other desirable properties for up to 11 voters, proving the
optimality of the above bound. We also obtain tight results for set-valued and
probabilistic voting rules, which complement and significantly improve existing
theorems.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The main idea of the {\em distance rationalizability} approach to view the
voters' preferences as an imperfect approximation to some kind of consensus is
deeply rooted in social choice literature. It allows one to define
(""rationalize"") voting rules via a consensus class of elections and a distance:
a candidate is said to be an election winner if she is ranked first in one of
the nearest (with respect to the given distance) consensus elections. It is
known that many classic voting rules can be distance rationalized. In this
paper, we provide new results on distance rationalizability of several
Condorcet-consistent voting rules. In particular, we distance rationalize
Young's rule and Maximin rule using distances similar to the Hamming distance.
We show that the claim that Young's rule can be rationalized by the Condorcet
consensus class and the Hamming distance is incorrect; in fact, these consensus
class and distance yield a new rule which has not been studied before. We prove
that, similarly to Young's rule, this new rule has a computationally hard
winner determination problem.

    Source Abstract:
    A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.

    In the realm of social choice theory, the study of voting rules and their susceptibility to various paradoxes has been a topic of significant interest. A key focus has been on Condorcet-consistent rules, which aim to select a candidate that would win in all pairwise majority comparisons. The exploration of these rules often intersects with the investigation of their computational properties and vulnerabilities to manipulation and paradoxes. Narodytska et al. (2011) delve into the manipulation of Nanson's and Baldwin's rules, highlighting their resistance to manipulation due to their NP-hardness in certain scenarios. This resistance is particularly relevant when considering the robustness of voting rules against strategic behavior, a theme that resonates with the examination of Condorcet extensions in our study, especially in the context of the reinforcement paradox.

Another critical aspect of voting rules is their interaction with the no-show paradox, where a voter's participation can lead to a less favorable outcome. Brandt et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive analysis of this paradox, leveraging SAT solving to refine the bounds established by Moulin (1988b). Their work demonstrates the incompatibility between Condorcet-consistency and participation, offering insights into the conditions under which these properties can coexist. This exploration is directly pertinent to our investigation, as we establish that refinements of maximin are immune to the no-show paradox in three-candidate elections, thereby contributing to the discourse on the optimal design of voting rules that balance Condorcet-consistency and participation.

The concept of distance rationalizability, as explored by Elkind et al. (2010), offers another perspective on Condorcet-consistent rules. By viewing voters' preferences as approximations to a consensus, this approach rationalizes voting rules through the lens of distance metrics. Their work on Young's rule and Maximin rule, using distances akin to the Hamming distance, underscores the complexity of winner determination problems in these contexts. This notion of rationalizability aligns with our axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, as we highlight their suitability for three-candidate elections and their immunity to certain paradoxes.

In summary, the existing literature provides a rich tapestry of insights into the computational and theoretical properties of voting rules, particularly those that are Condorcet-consistent. Our research builds upon these foundations by focusing on the specific case of three-candidate elections, offering new characterizations and demonstrating the immunity of certain refinements of maximin to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes. By contextualizing our findings within the broader discourse on voting rules, we contribute to the ongoing effort to design robust and fair mechanisms for collective decision-making.

        A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced.
This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy
and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the
ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the
perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum
profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase
space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the
microscopic chaos.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        In search for mathematically tractable models of anomalous diffusion, we
introduce a simple dynamical system consisting of a chain of coupled maps of
the interval whose Lyapunov exponents vanish everywhere. The volume preserving
property and the vanishing Lyapunov exponents are intended to mimic the
dynamics of polygonal billiards, which are known to give rise to anomalous
diffusion, but which are too complicated to be analyzed as thoroughly as
desired. Depending on the value taken by a single parameter \alpha, our map
experiences sub-diffusion, super-diffusion or normal diffusion. Therefore its
transport properties can be compared with those of given L\'evy walks
describing transport in quenched disordered media. Fixing \alpha\ so that the
mean square displacement generated by our map and that generated by the
corresponding L\'evy walk asymptotically coincide, we prove that all moments of
the corresponding asymptotic distributions coincide as well, hence all
observables which are expressed in terms of the moments coincide.

    In the study of dynamical systems and chaotic behavior, various models have been proposed to understand the intricate nature of diffusion and chaos. A significant contribution to this field is the exploration of map lattices, which serve as simplified yet insightful representations of complex systems. Salari et al. (2013) introduced a model of a chain of coupled maps with vanishing Lyapunov exponents, designed to mimic the dynamics of polygonal billiards. Their work demonstrates how such a system can exhibit sub-diffusion, super-diffusion, or normal diffusion, depending on a single parameter. This model provides a framework for comparing transport properties with Lévy walks, highlighting the potential for map lattices to model anomalous diffusion in a mathematically tractable manner (Salari, Rondoni, & Giberti, 2013).

In a similar vein, Raj and Paul (2024) investigated the role of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps. Their research focused on the impact of varying diffusion strength on the chaotic dynamics, particularly through the lens of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs). They found that increasing diffusion strength initially leads to a decrease in the leading Lyapunov exponent, creating a window of periodic dynamics before returning to chaos. This study provides valuable insights into how spatial coupling influences the localization of chaotic modes and the entanglement of CLVs, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between diffusion and chaos in coupled map lattices (Raj & Paul, 2024).

The work by Axenides et al. (2022) on Arnol'd cat map lattices further enriches the discourse on chaotic systems. By constructing lattice field theories in both phase and configuration space, they explore the chaotic properties of these systems through the symplectic group and the Fibonacci sequence. Their analysis of the spatio-temporal chaotic properties, using benchmarks such as unstable periodic orbits, underscores the ergodic and mixing behavior of these systems. This research highlights the dependence of chaotic dynamics on the strength and range of interactions, providing a comprehensive view of how cat map lattices can serve as a model for understanding chaos in dynamical systems (Axenides, Floratos, & Nicolis, 2022).

Building on these foundational studies, our research introduces a model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the ergodic properties of the dynamics along a chain with local perturbations, we observe ballistic growth of perturbation fronts and diffusive transport in phase space due to chaos-induced fluctuations. This work not only complements existing studies by providing a clear example of diffusion emerging from microscopic chaos but also advances the understanding of chaotic transport phenomena in coupled map lattices. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the relationship between chaos and diffusion, offering new perspectives and methodologies for future research in this domain.

        We explore the chaotic dynamics of a large one-dimensional lattice of coupled
maps with diffusive coupling of varying strength using the covariant Lyapunov
vectors (CLVs). Using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps we
quantify the growth of spatial structures in the chaotic dynamics as the
strength of diffusion is increased. When the diffusion strength is increased
from zero, we find that the leading Lyapunov exponent decreases rapidly from a
positive value to zero to yield a small window of periodic dynamics which is
then followed by chaotic dynamics. For values of the diffusion strength beyond
the window of periodic dynamics, the leading Lyapunov exponent does not vary
significantly with the strength of diffusion with the exception of a small
variation for the largest diffusion strengths we explore. The Lyapunov spectrum
and fractal dimension are described analytically as a function of the diffusion
strength using the eigenvalues of the coupling operator. The spatial features
of the CLVs are quantified and compared with the eigenvectors of the coupling
operator. The chaotic dynamics are composed entirely of physical modes for all
of the conditions we explore. The leading CLV is highly localized and the
localization decreases with increasing strength of the spatial coupling. The
violation of the dominance of Oseledets splitting indicates that the
entanglement of pairs of CLVs becomes more significant between neighboring CLVs
as the strength of the diffusion is increased.

        We construct Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories in phase space and
configuration space. In phase space we impose that the evolution operator of
the linearly coupled maps be an element of the symplectic group, in direct
generalization of the case of one map. To this end we exploit the
correspondence between the cat map and the Fibonacci sequence. The chaotic
properties of these systems can be, also, understood from the equations of
motion in configuration space, where they describe inverted harmonic
oscillators, with the runaway behavior of the potential competing with the
toroidal compactification of the phase space. We highlight the spatio-temporal
chaotic properties of these systems using standard benchmarks for probing
deterministic chaos of dynamical systems, namely the complete dense set of
unstable periodic orbits, which, for long periods, lead to ergodicity and
mixing. The spectrum of the periods exhibits a strong dependence on the
strength and the range of the interaction.

This study provides valuable insights into how spatial coupling influences the localization of chaotic modes and the entanglement of CLVs, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between diffusion and chaos in coupled map lattices (Raj & Paul, 2024).

The work by Axenides et al. (2022) on Arnol'd cat map lattices further enriches the discourse on chaotic systems. By constructing lattice field theories in both phase and configuration space, they explore the chaotic properties of these systems through the symplectic group and the Fibonacci sequence. Their analysis of the spatio-temporal chaotic properties, using benchmarks such as unstable periodic orbits, underscores the ergodic and mixing behavior of these systems. This research highlights the dependence of chaotic dynamics on the strength and range of interactions, providing a comprehensive view of how cat map lattices can serve as a model for understanding chaos in dynamical systems (Axenides, Floratos, & Nicolis, 2022).

Building on these foundational studies, our research introduces a model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the ergodic properties of the dynamics along a chain with local perturbations, we observe ballistic growth of perturbation fronts and diffusive transport in phase space due to chaos-induced fluctuations. This work not only complements existing studies by providing a clear example of diffusion emerging from microscopic chaos but also advances the understanding of chaotic transport phenomena in coupled map lattices. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the relationship between chaos and diffusion, offering new perspectives and methodologies for future research in this domain.

    ","In the study of dynamical systems and chaotic behavior, various models have been proposed to understand the intricate nature of diffusion and chaos. A significant contribution to this field is the exploration of map lattices, which serve as simplified yet insightful representations of complex systems. Salari et al. (2013) introduced a model of a chain of coupled maps with vanishing Lyapunov exponents, designed to mimic the dynamics of polygonal billiards. Their work demonstrates how such a system can exhibit sub-diffusion, super-diffusion, or normal diffusion, depending on a single parameter. This model provides a framework for comparing transport properties with Lévy walks, highlighting the potential for map lattices to model anomalous diffusion in a mathematically tractable manner (Salari, Rondoni, & Giberti, 2013).

In a similar vein, Raj and Paul (2024) investigated the role of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps. Their research focused on the impact of varying diffusion strength on the chaotic dynamics, particularly through the lens of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs). They found that increasing diffusion strength initially leads to a decrease in the leading Lyapunov exponent, creating a window of periodic dynamics before returning to chaos. This study provides valuable insights into how spatial coupling influences the localization of chaotic modes and the entanglement of CLVs, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between diffusion and chaos in coupled map lattices (Raj & Paul, 2024).

        Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models.
Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based
on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time
and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical
data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be
unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological
data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization
is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data
driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method
and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The accuracy of simulation-based forecasting in chaotic systems is heavily
dependent on high-quality estimates of the system state at the time the
forecast is initialized. Data assimilation methods are used to infer these
initial conditions by systematically combining noisy, incomplete observations
and numerical models of system dynamics to produce effective estimation
schemes. We introduce amortized assimilation, a framework for learning to
assimilate in dynamical systems from sequences of noisy observations with no
need for ground truth data. We motivate the framework by extending powerful
results from self-supervised denoising to the dynamical systems setting through
the use of differentiable simulation. Experimental results across several
benchmark systems highlight the improved effectiveness of our approach over
widely-used data assimilation methods.

    In recent years, the field of data assimilation has seen significant advancements, particularly in the context of chaotic and complex dynamical systems. A common theme among recent studies is the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data assimilation processes. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising in the context of dynamical systems. Their approach does not require ground truth data, making it particularly useful for chaotic systems where such data is often unavailable. This aligns with the growing trend of using machine learning to address the limitations of traditional data assimilation methods, which often rely on precise initial conditions and noise statistics.

Another significant contribution to the field is the development of software tools that facilitate the integration of deep learning models within data assimilation frameworks. Cheng et al.

This package supports various algorithms, including the Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, and demonstrates enhanced performance in high-dimensional systems like the Lorenz 63 model. The ability to seamlessly integrate deep learning models into data assimilation workflows represents a significant step forward in handling complex systems where traditional methods may fall short.

The challenge of sparse observations in high-dimensional systems has also been addressed through innovative methodologies. Xiao et al. (2024) introduced the Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF) method, which performs data assimilation in a latent space, thereby avoiding the need for full dynamics evolution. This approach is particularly valuable for real-time applications where computational efficiency is crucial. By encoding sparse observations using LSTM networks, LD-EnSF improves both the accuracy and robustness of data assimilation, highlighting the potential of latent space methods in overcoming the limitations of sparse data scenarios.

In addition to these advancements, the specification of observation error covariance remains a critical aspect of data assimilation. Cheng and Qiu (2021) proposed a data-driven approach using LSTM recurrent neural networks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of covariance specification. Their method eliminates the need for empirical assumptions about error distributions, offering a more flexible and accurate alternative to traditional covariance tuning algorithms. This work underscores the importance of accurate error modeling in enhancing the performance of data assimilation systems.

        Data assimilation techniques are often confronted with challenges handling
complex high dimensional physical systems, because high precision simulation in
complex high dimensional physical systems is computationally expensive and the
exact observation functions that can be applied in these systems are difficult
to obtain. It prompts growing interest in integrating deep learning models
within data assimilation workflows, but current software packages for data
assimilation cannot handle deep learning models inside. This study presents a
novel Python package seamlessly combining data assimilation with deep neural
networks to serve as models for state transition and observation functions. The
package, named TorchDA, implements Kalman Filter, Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF), 3D Variational (3DVar), and 4D Variational (4DVar) algorithms, allowing
flexible algorithm selection based on application requirements. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on the Lorenz 63 and a two-dimensional shallow water
system demonstrate significantly enhanced performance over standalone model
predictions without assimilation. The shallow water analysis validates data
assimilation capabilities mapping between different physical quantity spaces in
either full space or reduced order space. Overall, this innovative software
package enables flexible integration of deep learning representations within
data assimilation, conferring a versatile tool to tackle complex high
dimensional dynamical systems across scientific domains.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Data assimilation techniques are crucial for correcting the trajectory when
modeling complex physical systems. A recently developed data assimilation
method, Latent Ensemble Score Filter (Latent-EnSF), has shown great promise in
addressing the key limitation of EnSF for highly sparse observations in
high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. It performs data
assimilation in a latent space for encoded states and observations in every
assimilation step, and requires costly full dynamics to be evolved in the
original space. In this paper, we introduce Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF), a
novel methodology that completely avoids the full dynamics evolution and
significantly accelerates the data assimilation process, which is especially
valuable for complex dynamical problems that require fast data assimilation in
real time. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel variant of Latent Dynamics
Networks (LDNets) to effectively capture and preserve the system's dynamics
within a very low-dimensional latent space. Additionally, we propose a new
method for encoding sparse observations into the latent space using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage not only the current step's
observations, as in Latent-EnSF, but also all previous steps, thereby improving
the accuracy and robustness of the observation encoding. We demonstrate the
robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for two challenging
dynamical systems with highly sparse (in both space and time) and noisy
observations.

    ","In recent years, the field of data assimilation has seen significant advancements, particularly in the context of chaotic and complex dynamical systems. A common theme among recent studies is the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data assimilation processes. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising in the context of dynamical systems. Their approach does not require ground truth data, making it particularly useful for chaotic systems where such data is often unavailable. This aligns with the growing trend of using machine learning to address the limitations of traditional data assimilation methods, which often rely on precise initial conditions and noise statistics.

Another significant contribution to the field is the development of software tools that facilitate the integration of deep learning models within data assimilation frameworks. Cheng et al. (2024) presented TorchDA, a Python package that combines data assimilation with deep neural networks. This package supports various algorithms, including the Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, and demonstrates enhanced performance in high-dimensional systems like the Lorenz 63 model. The ability to seamlessly integrate deep learning models into data assimilation workflows represents a significant step forward in handling complex systems where traditional methods may fall short.

The challenge of sparse observations in high-dimensional systems has also been addressed through innovative methodologies. Xiao et al. (2024) introduced the Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF) method, which performs data assimilation in a latent space, thereby avoiding the need for full dynamics evolution. This approach is particularly valuable for real-time applications where computational efficiency is crucial. By encoding sparse observations using LSTM networks, LD-EnSF improves both the accuracy and robustness of data assimilation, highlighting the potential of latent space methods in overcoming the limitations of sparse data scenarios.

In addition to these advancements, the specification of observation error covariance remains a critical aspect of data assimilation. Cheng and Qiu (2021) proposed a data-driven approach using LSTM recurrent neural networks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of covariance specification. Their method eliminates the need for empirical assumptions about error distributions, offering a more flexible and accurate alternative to traditional covariance tuning algorithms. This work underscores the importance of accurate error modeling in enhancing the performance of data assimilation systems.

        Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models.
Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based
on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time
and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical
data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be
unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological
data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization
is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data
driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method
and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Data assimilation techniques are widely used to predict complex dynamical
systems with uncertainties, based on time-series observation data. Error
covariance matrices modelling is an important element in data assimilation
algorithms which can considerably impact the forecasting accuracy. The
estimation of these covariances, which usually relies on empirical assumptions
and physical constraints, is often imprecise and computationally expensive
especially for systems of large dimension. In this work, we propose a
data-driven approach based on long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
networks (RNN) to improve both the accuracy and the efficiency of observation
covariance specification in data assimilation for dynamical systems. Learning
the covariance matrix from observed/simulated time-series data, the proposed
approach does not require any knowledge or assumption about prior error
distribution, unlike classical posterior tuning methods. We have compared the
novel approach with two state-of-the-art covariance tuning algorithms, namely
DI01 and D05, first in a Lorenz dynamical system and then in a 2D shallow water
twin experiments framework with different covariance parameterization using
ensemble assimilation. This novel method shows significant advantages in
observation covariance specification, assimilation accuracy and computational
efficiency.

        This work explores systems where source updates

parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps
with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series

consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do
not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher
update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts
processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series
setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and

rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We
focus on a special case where updates require two computational

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        An optimal control problem with heterogeneous servers to minimize the average
age of information (AoI) is considered. Each server maintains a separate queue,
and each packet arriving to the system is randomly routed to one of the
servers. Assuming Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed service times,
we first derive an exact expression of the average AoI for two heterogeneous
servers. Next, to solve for the optimal average AoI, a close approximation is
derived, called the approximate AoI, this is shown to be useful for
multi-server systems as well. We show that for the optimal approximate AoI,
server utilization (ratio of arrival rate and service rate) for each server
should be same as the optimal server utilization with a single server queue.
For two identical servers, it is shown that the average AoI is approximately
5/8 times the average AoI of a single server. Furthermore, the average AoI is
shown to decrease considerably with the addition of more servers to the system.

    The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various queuing and network systems. Several studies have explored different aspects of AoI, particularly in systems with heterogeneous and tandem server setups. Bhati et al. (2021) investigate the AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers, where each server maintains a separate queue and packets are randomly routed. They derive an exact expression for the average AoI and propose an approximation useful for multi-server systems, highlighting that server utilization should be optimized similarly to single-server queues. This work provides foundational insights into optimizing AoI in systems with multiple servers, which is relevant to our exploration of parallel server setups where multiple processors work simultaneously (Bhati et al., 2021).

In tandem server systems, the focus shifts to the sequential processing of updates. Sinha et al. (2024) examine a communication system where updates pass through a series of queues in tandem, each with no buffer. They develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak AoI under preemptive and non-preemptive policies, offering insights into how AoI accumulates in such systems. Similarly, Yates (2018) studies networks of preemptive servers, characterizing the average AoI at each node in a series of network nodes. Both studies emphasize the impact of sequential processing on AoI, which aligns with our analysis of series server setups where each processor performs a specific step in sequence (Sinha et al., 2024; Yates, 2018).

The interplay between processing speed and power consumption is another critical aspect of AoI systems. Vaze and Nair (2019) explore speed scaling in tandem server settings, where servers have variable speeds and power consumption is a convex function of speed. They propose an online speed scaling algorithm that balances power consumption with processing speed, which is particularly relevant to our work's focus on the age-power trade-off. Our research extends this concept by formulating an optimization problem to determine optimal service rates under a power budget, specifically addressing the occurrence of wasted power when processing efforts do not reduce AoI (Vaze & Nair, 2019).

In summary, our work builds on these foundational studies by addressing the age-power trade-off in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. We contribute to the field by identifying scenarios where processing efforts lead to wasted power and proposing an optimization framework to mitigate this issue. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, our research provides practical insights into optimizing AoI performance while managing power consumption, bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications.

    ","The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various queuing and network systems. Several studies have explored different aspects of AoI, particularly in systems with heterogeneous and tandem server setups. Bhati et al. (2021) investigate the AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers, where each server maintains a separate queue and packets are randomly routed. They derive an exact expression for the average AoI and propose an approximation useful for multi-server systems, highlighting that server utilization should be optimized similarly to single-server queues. This work provides foundational insights into optimizing AoI in systems with multiple servers, which is relevant to our exploration of parallel server setups where multiple processors work simultaneously (Bhati et al., 2021).

In tandem server systems, the focus shifts to the sequential processing of updates. Sinha et al. (2024) examine a communication system where updates pass through a series of queues in tandem, each with no buffer. They develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak AoI under preemptive and non-preemptive policies, offering insights into how AoI accumulates in such systems. Similarly, Yates (2018) studies networks of preemptive servers, characterizing the average AoI at each node in a series of network nodes. Both studies emphasize the impact of sequential processing on AoI, which aligns with our analysis of series server setups where each processor performs a specific step in sequence (Sinha et al., 2024; Yates, 2018).

The interplay between processing speed and power consumption is another critical aspect of AoI systems. Vaze and Nair (2019) explore speed scaling in tandem server settings, where servers have variable speeds and power consumption is a convex function of speed. They propose an online speed scaling algorithm that balances power consumption with processing speed, which is particularly relevant to our work's focus on the age-power trade-off. Our research extends this concept by formulating an optimization problem to determine optimal service rates under a power budget, specifically addressing the occurrence of wasted power when processing efforts do not reduce AoI (Vaze & Nair, 2019).

In summary, our work builds on these foundational studies by addressing the age-power trade-off in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. We contribute to the field by identifying scenarios where processing efforts lead to wasted power and proposing an optimization framework to mitigate this issue. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, our research provides practical insights into optimizing AoI performance while managing power consumption, bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications.",mistral

        This work explores systems where source updates
require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and
analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various
system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In
parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps
with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series
setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In
practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also
consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do
not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher
update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts
processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series
setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and
solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service
rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We
focus on a special case where updates require two computational
steps.

        A source submits status updates to a network for delivery to a destination
monitor. Updates follow a route through a series of network nodes. Each node is
a last-come-first-served queue supporting preemption in service. We
characterize the average age of information at the input and output of each
node in the route induced by the updates passing through. For Poisson arrivals
to a line network of preemptive memoryless servers, we show that average age
accumulates through successive network nodes.

        Speed scaling for a tandem server setting is considered, where there is a
series of servers, and each job has to be processed by each of the servers in
sequence. Servers have a variable speed, their power consumption being a convex
increasing function of the speed. We consider the worst case setting as well as
the stochastic setting. In the worst case setting, the jobs are assumed to be
of unit size with arbitrary (possibly adversarially determined) arrival
instants. For this problem, we devise an online speed scaling algorithm that is
constant competitive with respect to the optimal offline algorithm that has
non-causal information. The proposed algorithm, at all times, uses the same
speed on all active servers, such that the total power consumption equals the
number of outstanding jobs. In the stochastic setting, we consider a more
general tandem network, with a parallel bank of servers at each stage. In this
setting, we show that random routing with a simple gated static speed selection
is constant competitive. In both cases, the competitive ratio depends only on
the power functions, and is independent of the workload and the number of
servers.

        Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical
and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new
families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper,
we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product
used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the

Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the
vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.

        Codes in the sum-rank metric have various applications in error control for
multishot network coding, distributed storage and code-based cryptography.
Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes contain Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes as
subclasses and fulfill the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric with
equality. We propose the first known error-erasure decoder for LRS codes to
unleash their full potential for multishot network coding. The presented
syndrome-based Berlekamp-Massey-like error-erasure decoder can correct $t_F$
full errors, $t_R$ row erasures and $t_C$ column erasures up to $2t_F + t_R +
t_C \leq n-k$ in the sum-rank metric requiring at most $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
operations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, where $n$ is the code's length and $k$ its
dimension. We show how the proposed decoder can be used to correct errors in
the sum-subspace metric that occur in (noncoherent) multishot network coding.

    The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research due to their significant applications in various fields such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Hörmann, Bartz, and Puchinger (2022), who explored the error-erasure decoding of Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes within the sum-rank metric. Their research highlights the versatility of LRS codes, which encompass both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes, and their ability to meet the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric. The authors introduced a novel error-erasure decoder that enhances the potential of LRS codes for multishot network coding, demonstrating its efficacy in correcting errors in the sum-subspace metric. This work underscores the importance of developing efficient decoding algorithms to leverage the full potential of rank-metric codes in practical applications.

In parallel, the exploration of subspace codes, as discussed by Sascha Kurz (2021), provides a complementary perspective on coding theory. Subspace codes, which can be viewed as the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming metric, have found applications in random linear network coding and distributed storage. Kurz's survey of known constructions and upper bounds for subspace codes offers valuable insights into the structural properties and limitations of these codes. The emphasis on vector spaces over finite fields aligns with the algebraic structures explored in rank-metric codes, highlighting the interconnectedness of these research areas.

Both of these works contribute to a broader understanding of the algebraic and geometric properties of codes in different metrics. The focus on decoding strategies in the sum-rank metric by Hörmann et al. (2022) and the structural analysis of subspace codes by Kurz (2021) provide a foundation for further exploration of code invariants and their applications. These studies illustrate the ongoing efforts to refine the theoretical underpinnings of coding theory and to develop practical solutions for error correction in various communication and storage systems.

Building on these foundational works, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we offer a new perspective on differentiating Gabidulin codes from random ones. This approach not only enhances the theoretical understanding of rank-metric codes but also provides practical tools for distinguishing between different code families. Our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the field by offering a geometric perspective on the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code, thereby enriching the landscape of coding theory with new insights and methodologies.

        Source Paper Abstract:
        Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical
and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new
families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper,
we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product
used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the
extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate
Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the
vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.

        Subspace codes are the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming
metric. Here the codewords are vector spaces over a finite field. They have
e.g. applications in random linear network coding, distributed storage, and
cryptography. In this chapter we survey known constructions and upper bounds
for subspace codes.

    The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research due to their significant applications in various fields such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Hörmann, Bartz, and Puchinger (2022), who explored the error-erasure decoding of Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes within the sum-rank metric. Their research highlights the versatility of LRS codes, which encompass both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes, and their ability to meet the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric. The authors introduced a novel error-erasure decoder that enhances the potential of LRS codes for multishot network coding, demonstrating its efficacy in correcting errors in the sum-subspace metric. This work underscores the importance of developing efficient decoding algorithms to leverage the full potential of rank-metric codes in practical applications.

In parallel, the exploration of subspace codes, as discussed by Sascha Kurz (2021), provides a complementary perspective on coding theory. Subspace codes, which can be viewed as the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming metric, have found applications in random linear network coding and distributed storage. Kurz's survey of known constructions and upper bounds for subspace codes offers valuable insights into the structural properties and limitations of these codes.
