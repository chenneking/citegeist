"CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not
fall out of a tree",,"In recent years, the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in code generation and understanding have been a focal point of research, with significant advancements being made in their ability to handle both static and dynamic aspects of programming languages. Liu et al. (2023) explore the limitations of pre-trained models in understanding code execution by introducing CodeExecutor, a model that leverages code execution pre-training and curriculum learning to enhance semantic comprehension. Their work highlights the importance of execution traces in improving code intelligence tasks, which aligns with our focus on evaluating LLMs' ability to trace execution paths in code [1].

Similarly, Armengol-Estapé et al. (2025) emphasize the significance of execution traces in training LLMs, proposing Execution Tuning (E.T.) as a method to incorporate real-world program execution traces into model training. Their findings demonstrate the advantages of dynamic scratchpads for handling long execution sequences, which is pertinent to our investigation of LLMs' performance on extended execution traces [3]. Both studies underscore the necessity of integrating dynamic execution information to enhance the models' understanding of code behavior, a theme central to our research.

Another line of research focuses on improving code reasoning through multimodal approaches. Le et al. (2024) introduce VisualCoder, which combines multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning with visual Control Flow Graphs to provide deeper insights into code execution flows. This approach addresses the challenges of aligning code snippets with their execution paths, thereby enhancing program behavior prediction and error detection [2]. Our work similarly seeks to evaluate the structural understanding of code by LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios involving recursion, parallel processing, and object-oriented programming.

In the realm of semantic understanding, Ma et al. (2023) propose the Semantic Chain-of-Thought (SeCoT) approach, which integrates semantic information such as data flow and control flow into LLMs to improve code generation accuracy. By leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs for in-context learning, SeCoT automates the process of semantic feature extraction, which is crucial for bridging the gap between natural language requirements and code generation [4]. This approach resonates with our goal of assessing LLMs' ability to navigate and understand advanced structural components in code.

Our research builds upon these foundational works by introducing the Benchmark CoCoNUT, which specifically evaluates LLMs' ability to trace execution paths in code, including advanced structural components not extensively covered in existing benchmarks. By focusing on the structural control flow of code, our work aims to highlight the current limitations of LLMs in code reasoning and provide a dataset that can aid researchers in addressing these challenges. We hope that our findings will contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance the semantic and dynamic understanding of code by LLMs, ultimately bridging the gap between human-like code reasoning and machine capabilities.",large language models code generation execution tracing code control flow,"['Chenxiao Liu, Shuai Lu, Weizhu Chen, Daxin Jiang, Alexey Svyatkovskiy, Shengyu Fu, Neel Sundaresan, Nan Duan (2023).

"Partially private, optimistic, distributed, and verifiable machine learning inference",,"The intersection of machine learning (ML) and privacy has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly with the advent of techniques that ensure privacy during model inference. A prominent approach in this domain is the use of zero-knowledge proofs, such as zkSNARKs, to provide verifiable evaluations of ML models. South et al. (2024) explore this concept by presenting a method for verifiable model evaluation using zkSNARKs, which allows model outputs to be verified without revealing the underlying model parameters. Their work focuses on creating zero-knowledge computational proofs that can be used to attest to the performance and fairness of models with private weights over public inputs. This approach introduces a new transparency paradigm, enabling end-users to trust model evaluations without needing access to the model itself (South et al., 2024).

The use of zkSNARKs in ML has primarily been directed towards ensuring the integrity and verifiability of model outputs, as demonstrated by South et al. (2024). However, the privacy of model parameters during inference remains an underexplored area. While South et al. provide a framework for verifying model outputs, they do not address the selective revelation of model sections, which is crucial for maintaining privacy in distributed ML environments. This gap highlights the need for solutions that not only verify model outputs but also protect the privacy of model parameters during inference, especially in scenarios involving distributed nodes with varying trust levels.

Our research builds upon the foundational work of South et al. by extending the application of zkSNARKs to enable partial privacy of model parameters during distributed ML inference. Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on output verification, our solution allows model providers to selectively reveal model sections, ensuring both verifiable and tamper-proof inference across a customizable set of trusted and untrusted nodes. This selective revelation is particularly beneficial in distributed environments, such as ML edge computing and LoRA fine-tuned models, where privacy and trust among participants are paramount. By addressing the scalability challenges associated with proving and setup operations, our work paves the way for practical implementations of privacy-preserving inference in larger models.

In summary, while existing research has laid the groundwork for verifiable model evaluations using zkSNARKs, our work addresses the critical need for privacy of model parameters during inference. By enabling selective revelation of model sections, we provide a novel approach that enhances trust and privacy in distributed ML environments. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, highlighting minimal inference overhead and identifying areas for future optimization. This contribution not only advances the field of privacy-preserving ML but also opens new avenues for deploying secure and trustworthy ML models in diverse applications.",privacy in machine learning inference using zkSNARKs,"[""Tobin South, Alexander Camuto, Shrey Jain, Shayla Nguyen, Robert Mahari, Christian Paquin, Jason Morton, Alex 'Sandy' Pentland (2024).

"SpikeDecoder: Realizing the GPT Architecture
with Spiking Neural Networks",,"The exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP). Xingrun Xing et al. (2024) in their work ""SpikeLM: Towards General Spike-Driven Language Modeling via Elastic Bi-Spiking Mechanisms"" have made notable strides in this domain by introducing a fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks. Their approach addresses the challenge of encoding semantic information in binary spikes by proposing a bi-directional, elastic amplitude, and frequency encoding mechanism. This innovation significantly narrows the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling, demonstrating the potential of spike-driven models in handling both discriminative and generative language tasks. The introduction of the elastic bi-spiking mechanism marks a pivotal advancement in the application of SNNs to NLP, providing a foundation for further exploration in this field (Xing et al., 2024).

Similarly, the work by R. Alexander Knipper et al. (2024) titled ""SNNLP: Energy-Efficient Natural Language Processing Using Spiking Neural Networks"" delves into the application of SNNs in NLP, emphasizing the energy efficiency of these models. The authors highlight the challenges associated with encoding text into spike trains, a critical step for integrating NLP tasks into the neuromorphic setting. By comparing various text encoding methods, they propose a novel approach that surpasses the traditional Poisson rate-coding technique, achieving a 13% improvement in benchmark NLP tasks. Their findings underscore the substantial energy savings of SNNs over conventional deep neural networks, with a reported 32x increase in energy efficiency during inference and 60x during training. This work not only reinforces the viability of SNNs in NLP but also provides practical insights into optimizing text encoding for spike-based models (Knipper et al., 2024).

Both of these studies underscore the growing interest in leveraging the energy-efficient properties of SNNs for NLP applications. While Xing et al. (2024) focus on enhancing the semantic encoding capabilities of spikes, Knipper et al. (2024) address the practical challenges of text-to-spike conversion and demonstrate the energy benefits of SNNs. These complementary approaches highlight the multifaceted nature of integrating SNNs into NLP, from theoretical advancements in spike encoding to practical implementations in energy-efficient computing.

In the context of this evolving landscape, our work introduces SpikeDecoder, a fully spike-based low-power version of the Transformer decoder-only model, specifically designed for NLP applications. By building on the foundational insights provided by previous research, we aim to further reduce energy consumption while maintaining performance. Our investigation into the replacement of ANN components with spike-based alternatives, the role of residual connections, and the selection of spike-compatible normalization techniques offers a comprehensive approach to optimizing SNNs for NLP. Additionally, our exploration of different embedding methods to project text data into spike-range aligns with the challenges identified by Knipper et al. (2024), providing a holistic view of the potential and limitations of SNNs in this domain. Through this work, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on energy-efficient NLP models, demonstrating significant reductions in theoretical energy consumption and paving the way for future innovations in spike-based language processing.",spiking neural networks natural language processing,"['Xingrun Xing, Zheng Zhang, Ziyi Ni, Shitao Xiao, Yiming Ju, Siqi Fan, Yequan Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Guoqi Li (2024).

"T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image
is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs",2411.19951,"The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements, particularly in integrating diverse data forms such as text, images, audio, and video. This integration is crucial for developing models that can understand and process multiple modalities simultaneously. Chunyuan Li (2023) provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of large multimodal models, emphasizing the transition from vision-and-language models to more complex systems like multimodal GPT-4. This work highlights the importance of instruction-tuning in enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs, a concept that is foundational to our research as we explore the extension of these models into video understanding domains [1].

Further expanding on the theme of multimodal integration, Han et al. (2024) delve into the technical challenges and advancements in multimodal pretrained models. Their tutorial underscores the necessity of optimizing these models for specific tasks through instruction tuning, which aligns with our approach of fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs for video data. The authors also discuss the latest datasets and models, providing a backdrop against which our method, T2Vid, can be seen as a novel contribution to enriching instruction diversity and improving learning efficiency in video understanding [2].

Wu et al. (2023) offer a survey that explores the historical development and current state of multimodal language models. They address the limitations of traditional large language models in handling non-textual data and propose multimodal models as a solution. This survey provides valuable insights into the challenges and applications of multimodal models, which are pertinent to our study. Our work builds on these insights by identifying specific limitations in zero-shot inference and proposing a data augmentation method to overcome these challenges, thereby enhancing the temporal understanding capabilities of MLLMs in video contexts [3].

In summary, the existing literature underscores the potential and challenges of MLLMs in processing diverse data types. Our research contributes to this field by addressing the specific limitations of zero-shot inference and fine-tuning approaches in video understanding. By introducing the T2Vid method, we aim to enrich the training corpus with synthesized video-like samples, thereby improving learning efficiency and performance.

Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners,2411.19865,"In recent years, the exploration of human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence has gained significant attention, with various frameworks proposed to enhance AI's cognitive capabilities. One such approach is AI Thinking, introduced by Denis Newman-Griffis (2024), which emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary perspectives in AI application. AI Thinking provides a conceptual framework that models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across different contexts, focusing on competencies such as motivating AI use, formulating methods, and situating AI within sociotechnical environments. This framework highlights the necessity of bridging divides between academic disciplines to reshape AI's future in practice. While AI Thinking primarily addresses the practical application of AI, it underscores the importance of structured reasoning processes, which align with the goals of our Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (REVTHINK) framework. By augmenting datasets with structured forward-backward reasoning, REVTHINK aims to enhance reasoning performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby contributing to the broader discourse on AI literacy and innovation.

Another significant contribution to the field is the introduction of lateral thinking in AI systems, as discussed by Stefan Dernbach et al. (2024) in their work on Streaming Agentic Lateral Thinking (SALT). SALT is a multi-agent framework designed to implement System-2 reasoning capabilities, focusing on anticipatory and causal reasoning under uncertainty. The framework leverages lateral information flow across agent interactions to enhance reasoning in complex, low-specificity queries within streaming data environments. This approach to reasoning, which emphasizes dynamic communication and belief management, shares thematic similarities with REVTHINK's focus on reverse thinking. Both frameworks aim to enrich the reasoning capabilities of AI systems by incorporating diverse thinking processes, whether through lateral or reverse reasoning. The insights from SALT's multi-agent approach provide valuable context for understanding how structured reasoning can be systematically integrated into AI models, further supporting the objectives of REVTHINK.

In the realm of imitation learning, Shengran Hu and Jeff Clune (2023) propose Thought Cloning, a framework that trains AI agents to think like humans by imitating human thoughts alongside behaviors. Thought Cloning emphasizes the role of language in human thinking, aiming to improve AI agents' generalization, exploration, and adaptability. By observing and replicating human thought processes, Thought Cloning enhances AI safety and interpretability, allowing for better debugging and steering of agents. This approach resonates with the goals of REVTHINK, which seeks to enable LLMs to perform reverse thinking by training them on structured reasoning tasks. Both Thought Cloning and REVTHINK highlight the importance of integrating human-like cognitive processes into AI systems to improve their performance and generalization capabilities, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

In summary, the exploration of human-like reasoning in AI, as demonstrated by AI Thinking, SALT, and Thought Cloning, provides a rich context for the development of frameworks like REVTHINK. Our work builds upon these foundational ideas by introducing a novel approach to reverse thinking in LLMs, leveraging structured reasoning tasks to enhance performance and generalization. By situating REVTHINK within the broader discourse on AI reasoning, we contribute to the ongoing efforts to create more powerful, efficient, and human-like AI systems.

Money Burning Improves Mediated Communication,2411.19431,"In the realm of Bayesian persuasion, the concept of commitment power plays a pivotal role in shaping the strategic interactions between senders and receivers. The work by Shih-Tang Su and Vijay G. Subramanian (2022) delves into the dynamics of commitment in scenarios involving multiple senders, particularly focusing on the order of commitments in sequential signaling settings. Their research highlights how the sequence in which commitments are made can significantly influence equilibrium payoffs and strategies, especially when senders possess partial information about the state of the world. This exploration of commitment order is relevant to our study, as it underscores the importance of strategic commitment in enhancing the sender's payoff, a theme central to our investigation of money-burning tactics in mediated communication [Su & Subramanian, 2022].

Another significant contribution to the literature on Bayesian persuasion is the study by Itai Arieli, Yakov Babichenko, and Fedor Sandomirskiy (2022), which examines the role of mediators in the communication process. Their work characterizes the sender's optimal value in the presence of mediators and reveals that while a single mediator does not benefit the sender, the introduction of a second mediator can enhance the sender's value. This finding is particularly intriguing as it suggests that the structure of the communication channel can impact the effectiveness of persuasion strategies. Our research extends this line of inquiry by introducing money-burning as a mechanism within the communication model, thereby offering a novel approach to enhancing commitment power in mediated settings [Arieli et al., 2022].

The exploration of multi-channel communication structures by Yakov Babichenko, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Haifeng Xu, and Konstantin Zabarnyi (2021) further enriches the discourse on Bayesian persuasion. Their study provides a comprehensive characterization of when one communication structure is superior to another, based on the concept of information dominance among receivers. This work is particularly relevant to our research as it highlights the complexity and strategic considerations involved in designing effective communication mechanisms. By incorporating money-burning tactics, our model adds an additional layer of strategic depth, allowing the sender to leverage commitment power more effectively across different communication channels [Babichenko et al., 2021].

In the context of mediated communication without commitment power, the study by Itai Arieli, Ivan Geffner, and Moshe Tennenholtz (2022) investigates the design of cheap talk mechanisms involving multiple informed senders and a receiver. Their research characterizes the set of implementable action distributions and provides algorithms for computing optimal equilibria. This work complements our study by highlighting the challenges and opportunities in designing communication mechanisms that can achieve desired outcomes even in the absence of commitment power. Our research builds on these insights by demonstrating how money-burning can serve as a commitment device, thereby enhancing the sender's ability to influence the receiver's actions [Arieli et al., 2022].

In summary, our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on Bayesian persuasion by introducing a novel approach that integrates money-burning tactics into mediated communication models. By characterizing the sender's maximum equilibrium payoff and demonstrating the effectiveness of money-burning in enhancing commitment power, our work offers new insights into the strategic design of communication mechanisms. Furthermore, our model's applicability to Web 3.0 communities underscores its relevance in contemporary digital contexts, where commitment and trust are increasingly critical. Through this exploration, we aim to advance the understanding of how strategic communication can be optimized to achieve desired outcomes in complex, mediated environments.","mediated communication, money-burning tactics, commitment power, Bayesian persuasion, Web 3.0 communities","['Shih-Tang Su, Vijay G.

"Condorcet-Consistent Choice
Among Three Candidates",2411.19857,"In the realm of social choice theory, the study of voting rules and their susceptibility to various paradoxes has been a topic of significant interest. A key focus has been on Condorcet-consistent rules, which aim to select a candidate that would win in all pairwise majority comparisons. The exploration of these rules often intersects with the investigation of their computational properties and vulnerabilities to manipulation and paradoxes. Narodytska et al. (2011) delve into the manipulation of Nanson's and Baldwin's rules, highlighting their resistance to manipulation due to their NP-hardness in certain scenarios. This resistance is particularly relevant when considering the robustness of voting rules against strategic behavior, a theme that resonates with the examination of Condorcet extensions in our study, especially in the context of the reinforcement paradox.

Another critical aspect of voting rules is their interaction with the no-show paradox, where a voter's participation can lead to a less favorable outcome. Brandt et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive analysis of this paradox, leveraging SAT solving to refine the bounds established by Moulin (1988b). Their work demonstrates the incompatibility between Condorcet-consistency and participation, offering insights into the conditions under which these properties can coexist. This exploration is directly pertinent to our investigation, as we establish that refinements of maximin are immune to the no-show paradox in three-candidate elections, thereby contributing to the discourse on the optimal design of voting rules that balance Condorcet-consistency and participation.

The concept of distance rationalizability, as explored by Elkind et al. (2010), offers another perspective on Condorcet-consistent rules. By viewing voters' preferences as approximations to a consensus, this approach rationalizes voting rules through the lens of distance metrics. Their work on Young's rule and Maximin rule, using distances akin to the Hamming distance, underscores the complexity of winner determination problems in these contexts. This notion of rationalizability aligns with our axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, as we highlight their suitability for three-candidate elections and their immunity to certain paradoxes.

In summary, the existing literature provides a rich tapestry of insights into the computational and theoretical properties of voting rules, particularly those that are Condorcet-consistent. Our research builds upon these foundations by focusing on the specific case of three-candidate elections, offering new characterizations and demonstrating the immunity of certain refinements of maximin to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes. By contextualizing our findings within the broader discourse on voting rules, we contribute to the ongoing effort to design robust and fair mechanisms for collective decision-making.",Condorcet extensions voting rules reinforcement paradox no-show paradox maximin Nanson,"[""Nina Narodytska, Toby Walsh, Lirong Xia (2011).

Classical transport in a maximally chaotic chain,2411.19828,"In the study of dynamical systems and chaotic behavior, various models have been proposed to understand the intricate nature of diffusion and chaos. A significant contribution to this field is the exploration of map lattices, which serve as simplified yet insightful representations of complex systems. Salari et al. (2013) introduced a model of a chain of coupled maps with vanishing Lyapunov exponents, designed to mimic the dynamics of polygonal billiards. Their work demonstrates how such a system can exhibit sub-diffusion, super-diffusion, or normal diffusion, depending on a single parameter. This model provides a framework for comparing transport properties with Lévy walks, highlighting the potential for map lattices to model anomalous diffusion in a mathematically tractable manner (Salari, Rondoni, & Giberti, 2013).

In a similar vein, Raj and Paul (2024) investigated the role of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps. Their research focused on the impact of varying diffusion strength on the chaotic dynamics, particularly through the lens of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs). They found that increasing diffusion strength initially leads to a decrease in the leading Lyapunov exponent, creating a window of periodic dynamics before returning to chaos. This study provides valuable insights into how spatial coupling influences the localization of chaotic modes and the entanglement of CLVs, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between diffusion and chaos in coupled map lattices (Raj & Paul, 2024).

The work by Axenides et al. (2022) on Arnol'd cat map lattices further enriches the discourse on chaotic systems. By constructing lattice field theories in both phase and configuration space, they explore the chaotic properties of these systems through the symplectic group and the Fibonacci sequence. Their analysis of the spatio-temporal chaotic properties, using benchmarks such as unstable periodic orbits, underscores the ergodic and mixing behavior of these systems. This research highlights the dependence of chaotic dynamics on the strength and range of interactions, providing a comprehensive view of how cat map lattices can serve as a model for understanding chaos in dynamical systems (Axenides, Floratos, & Nicolis, 2022).

Building on these foundational studies, our research introduces a model for a lattice of coupled cat maps with a specific coupling choice that simplifies the description and allows for the exact determination of nontrivial quantities like Lyapunov exponents. By examining the ergodic properties of the dynamics along a chain with local perturbations, we observe ballistic growth of perturbation fronts and diffusive transport in phase space due to chaos-induced fluctuations. This work not only complements existing studies by providing a clear example of diffusion emerging from microscopic chaos but also advances the understanding of chaotic transport phenomena in coupled map lattices. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the relationship between chaos and diffusion, offering new perspectives and methodologies for future research in this domain.",lattice models coupled cat maps Lyapunov exponents ergodic properties chaos diffusive transport,"['Lucia Salari, Lamberto Rondoni, Claudio Giberti (2013).

Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,2411.18627,"In recent years, the field of data assimilation has seen significant advancements, particularly in the context of chaotic and complex dynamical systems. A common theme among recent studies is the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data assimilation processes. McCabe and Brown (2021) introduced the concept of amortized assimilation, which leverages self-supervised denoising in the context of dynamical systems. Their approach does not require ground truth data, making it particularly useful for chaotic systems where such data is often unavailable. This aligns with the growing trend of using machine learning to address the limitations of traditional data assimilation methods, which often rely on precise initial conditions and noise statistics.

Another significant contribution to the field is the development of software tools that facilitate the integration of deep learning models within data assimilation frameworks. Cheng et al. (2024) presented TorchDA, a Python package that combines data assimilation with deep neural networks. This package supports various algorithms, including the Kalman Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter, and demonstrates enhanced performance in high-dimensional systems like the Lorenz 63 model. The ability to seamlessly integrate deep learning models into data assimilation workflows represents a significant step forward in handling complex systems where traditional methods may fall short.

The challenge of sparse observations in high-dimensional systems has also been addressed through innovative methodologies. Xiao et al. (2024) introduced the Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF) method, which performs data assimilation in a latent space, thereby avoiding the need for full dynamics evolution. This approach is particularly valuable for real-time applications where computational efficiency is crucial. By encoding sparse observations using LSTM networks, LD-EnSF improves both the accuracy and robustness of data assimilation, highlighting the potential of latent space methods in overcoming the limitations of sparse data scenarios.

In addition to these advancements, the specification of observation error covariance remains a critical aspect of data assimilation. Cheng and Qiu (2021) proposed a data-driven approach using LSTM recurrent neural networks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of covariance specification. Their method eliminates the need for empirical assumptions about error distributions, offering a more flexible and accurate alternative to traditional covariance tuning algorithms. This work underscores the importance of accurate error modeling in enhancing the performance of data assimilation systems.

In the context of these developments, our research introduces a novel data assimilation algorithm grounded in topological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, our method optimizes topological differences between measurements and predictions without relying on noise information. This approach addresses the challenge of unknown measurement noise statistics, a common limitation in classical data assimilation algorithms. By focusing on the chaotic Lorenz system, we demonstrate the potential of our method to improve prediction accuracy in complex dynamical systems, contributing to the ongoing evolution of data-driven modeling techniques in the field.",data-driven modeling dynamical systems data assimilation,"['Michael McCabe, Jed Brown (2021).

"Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update
Processing",2411.19854v1,"The Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in evaluating the timeliness of information in various queuing and network systems. Several studies have explored different aspects of AoI, particularly in systems with heterogeneous and tandem server setups. Bhati et al. (2021) investigate the AoI in queuing systems with heterogeneous servers, where each server maintains a separate queue and packets are randomly routed. They derive an exact expression for the average AoI and propose an approximation useful for multi-server systems, highlighting that server utilization should be optimized similarly to single-server queues. This work provides foundational insights into optimizing AoI in systems with multiple servers, which is relevant to our exploration of parallel server setups where multiple processors work simultaneously (Bhati et al., 2021).

In tandem server systems, the focus shifts to the sequential processing of updates. Sinha et al. (2024) examine a communication system where updates pass through a series of queues in tandem, each with no buffer. They develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak AoI under preemptive and non-preemptive policies, offering insights into how AoI accumulates in such systems. Similarly, Yates (2018) studies networks of preemptive servers, characterizing the average AoI at each node in a series of network nodes. Both studies emphasize the impact of sequential processing on AoI, which aligns with our analysis of series server setups where each processor performs a specific step in sequence (Sinha et al., 2024; Yates, 2018).

The interplay between processing speed and power consumption is another critical aspect of AoI systems. Vaze and Nair (2019) explore speed scaling in tandem server settings, where servers have variable speeds and power consumption is a convex function of speed. They propose an online speed scaling algorithm that balances power consumption with processing speed, which is particularly relevant to our work's focus on the age-power trade-off. Our research extends this concept by formulating an optimization problem to determine optimal service rates under a power budget, specifically addressing the occurrence of wasted power when processing efforts do not reduce AoI (Vaze & Nair, 2019).

In summary, our work builds on these foundational studies by addressing the age-power trade-off in systems requiring multiple sequential processing steps. We contribute to the field by identifying scenarios where processing efforts lead to wasted power and proposing an optimization framework to mitigate this issue. By focusing on a special case where updates require two computational steps, our research provides practical insights into optimizing AoI performance while managing power consumption, bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications.",Age of Information parallel series server setups,"['Anhad Bhati, Sibi Raj B.

A GEOMETRIC INVARIANT OF LINEAR RANK-METRIC CODES,2411.19087,"The study of rank-metric codes has been a vibrant area of research due to their significant applications in various fields such as network coding, distributed storage, and cryptography. A notable contribution in this domain is the work by Hörmann, Bartz, and Puchinger (2022), who explored the error-erasure decoding of Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes within the sum-rank metric. Their research highlights the versatility of LRS codes, which encompass both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes, and their ability to meet the Singleton-like bound in the sum-rank metric. The authors introduced a novel error-erasure decoder that enhances the potential of LRS codes for multishot network coding, demonstrating its efficacy in correcting errors in the sum-subspace metric. This work underscores the importance of developing efficient decoding algorithms to leverage the full potential of rank-metric codes in practical applications.

In parallel, the exploration of subspace codes, as discussed by Sascha Kurz (2021), provides a complementary perspective on coding theory. Subspace codes, which can be viewed as the $q$-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming metric, have found applications in random linear network coding and distributed storage. Kurz's survey of known constructions and upper bounds for subspace codes offers valuable insights into the structural properties and limitations of these codes. The emphasis on vector spaces over finite fields aligns with the algebraic structures explored in rank-metric codes, highlighting the interconnectedness of these research areas.

Both of these works contribute to a broader understanding of the algebraic and geometric properties of codes in different metrics. The focus on decoding strategies in the sum-rank metric by Hörmann et al. (2022) and the structural analysis of subspace codes by Kurz (2021) provide a foundation for further exploration of code invariants and their applications. These studies illustrate the ongoing efforts to refine the theoretical underpinnings of coding theory and to develop practical solutions for error correction in various communication and storage systems.

Building on these foundational works, our research introduces a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we offer a new perspective on differentiating Gabidulin codes from random ones. This approach not only enhances the theoretical understanding of rank-metric codes but also provides practical tools for distinguishing between different code families. Our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the field by offering a geometric perspective on the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code, thereby enriching the landscape of coding theory with new insights and methodologies.",rank-metric codes network coding distributed storage post-quantum cryptography,"['Felicitas Hörmann, Hannes Bartz, Sven Puchinger (2022).
