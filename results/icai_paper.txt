Abstract:
In aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), popular methods like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) use human-annotated preference data to optimize outputs based on pairwise comparisons. However, these approaches lack explicit guiding principles, leading to limited interpretability in alignment criteria.
Constitutional AI (CAI), introduced by Anthropic (Bai et al., 2022), offers a rule-based alternative using a pre-defined constitution to guide alignment. This constitution, based on ethical and safety principles, directs outputs and promotes desired behaviors more transparently. Building on this, an area of research termed Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) (Findeis et al., 2024) has been introduced, which aims to derive such constitutions from existing preference datasets rather than pre-defining them. ICAI could reveal implicit alignment goals and provide an interpretable set of rules from data originally optimized for pairwise preferences. We hypothesize that these constitutional principles could then possibly be used as an alternative to typical (and complex) alignment approaches in a prompting-based manner, steering outputs to follow the provided set of principles.
This project investigates two core questions: (1) How can we improve on existing constitutional extraction methods on pair-wise preference human datasets? (2) Further, can these constitutions be directly used in a prompting context as a competitive alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods?

The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences has been a focal point of research, with various methodologies proposed to enhance interpretability and efficiency. Traditional approaches like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have been critiqued for their complexity and lack of transparency. In response, alternative methods have emerged, each offering unique perspectives on model alignment. For instance, NEAT introduces a dual feedback mechanism by incorporating negative prompts to explicitly penalize undesirable outputs, thereby enhancing alignment with human values through both positive and negative examples (Qiao et al., 2024). This approach complements the concept of Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI), which seeks to derive constitutions from preference datasets, as both methods aim to improve model alignment through more interpretable and transparent means. Similarly, Linear Alignment offers a closed-form solution for policy optimization, eliminating the need for extensive training and data annotation, which aligns with ICAI's goal of using constitutions in a prompting context as a simpler alternative to complex fine-tuning methods (Gao et al., 2024).

The exploration of preference distinguishability and its impact on model updates is another critical area of research. Im and Li's theoretical analysis of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) highlights the importance of understanding implicit alignment goals in preference datasets, which is directly relevant to ICAI's objective of extracting constitutions from such data (Im & Li, 2024). This insight is further supported by Xiao et al.'s comprehensive review of DPO, which underscores the challenges and opportunities in optimizing model alignment without relying on traditional RL methods (Xiao et al., 2024). Both works emphasize the need for alternative alignment methodologies that enhance interpretability and transparency, aligning with ICAI's approach.

The flexibility and adaptability of alignment methods are also crucial considerations. MetaAlign addresses the limitations of static alignment by enabling real-time preference adaptation during inference, which resonates with ICAI's aim to derive flexible alignment principles from data (Zhang et al., 2024). This dynamic approach contrasts with traditional methods and supports the development of ICAI's prompting-based alignment strategies. Similarly, MEET introduces a parameter-efficient tuning approach to optimize control tokens for controllable generation, enhancing the flexibility and interpretability of LLM alignment (Xue et al., 2023). Both MetaAlign and MEET highlight the potential for more adaptable alignment frameworks, albeit through different methodologies.

The integration of alternative learning frameworks further enriches the landscape of alignment research. Progressively Label Enhancement (PLE) offers a dynamic approach to training by adjusting the process based on data quality, contrasting with static methods and aligning with ICAI's exploration of alternative alignment methods (Liu et al., 2024). Additionally, the Contrastive Learning Framework for Human Alignment (CLHA) simplifies alignment by employing a reward rescoring strategy and pairwise contrastive loss, directly aligning LLMs with human preferences (Fang et al., 2024). Both PLE and CLHA aim to improve alignment transparency and efficiency, paralleling ICAI's focus on deriving constitutions from preference data.

Finally, the comprehensive framework for understanding preference alignment strategies provided by Gao et al. offers a unified perspective on the complexity and interconnections of existing alignment methods (Gao et al., 2024). This survey supports ICAI's goal of simplifying alignment processes by deriving constitutions from preference datasets, highlighting the potential for more interpretable and rule-based alignment methods. By establishing connections among various strategies, this work informs the development of alternative approaches like ICAI, which seek to enhance interpretability and transparency in alignment criteria.
