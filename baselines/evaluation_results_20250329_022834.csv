        Source Paper Abstract:
        A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        We propose the maximin support method, a novel extension of the D'Hondt
apportionment method to approval-based multiwinner elections. The maximin
support method is based on maximizing the support of the least supported
elected candidate. It can be computed efficiently and satisfies (adjusted
versions of) the main properties of the original D'Hondt method: house
monotonicity, population monotonicity, and proportional representation. We also
establish a close relationship between the maximin support method and
Phragm\'{e}n's voting rules.

    In the realm of social choice theory, the study of Condorcet extensions and their susceptibility to paradoxes has been a focal point of research. Several works have explored various aspects of Condorcet-consistent voting rules, providing insights into their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications. A significant contribution to this field is the exploration of distance rationalizability, as discussed by Elkind, Faliszewski, and Slinko (2010). Their work investigates the rationalization of Condorcet-consistent rules using distances akin to the Hamming distance, offering a novel perspective on how these rules can be conceptualized. This approach is particularly relevant to our study, as it highlights the complexity and computational challenges associated with Condorcet extensions, which are central to understanding their susceptibility to paradoxes.

Another pertinent area of research is the computational complexity of Condorcet-consistent voting rules, as examined by Schlotter and Cechlárová (2025). Their analysis of the Possible President problem provides a comprehensive view of the computational challenges faced by various Condorcet-consistent rules, including Maximin. By classifying cases based on the number of voters and other parameters, they delineate the boundaries of tractability for these problems. This work complements our investigation by underscoring the computational aspects of Condorcet extensions, particularly in the context of three-candidate elections, where paradoxes such as the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes are prevalent.

The manipulation of Condorcet-consistent voting rules is another critical theme explored in the literature. Peters (2017) addresses the preference reversal paradox, demonstrating the vulnerability of these rules to strategic manipulation by voters. This study is instrumental in understanding the broader implications of Condorcet extensions, as it reveals inherent weaknesses that can be exploited under certain conditions. Our research builds on this foundation by examining specific paradoxes that arise in three-candidate scenarios, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations and potential refinements of Condorcet extensions.

The Maximin rule, a central focus of our paper, has been extended to various voting contexts, as illustrated by Sánchez-Fernández et al. (2016). Their work on the maximin support method extends the D'Hondt apportionment method to approval-based multiwinner elections, showcasing the versatility and applicability of maximin principles. This extension is particularly relevant to our study, as it highlights the adaptability of maximin refinements in addressing paradoxes within Condorcet extensions. By demonstrating the immunity of certain maximin refinements to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes, our research aligns with the broader discourse on enhancing the robustness of voting rules.

In summary, our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on Condorcet extensions by providing a focused analysis of their susceptibility to paradoxes in three-candidate elections. By establishing the conditions under which these paradoxes occur and identifying refinements of maximin that are immune to them, we offer a novel perspective on the suitability of these voting rules. Our axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements further enrich the theoretical landscape, paving the way for future research on the refinement and application of Condorcet-consistent rules in diverse electoral contexts.

        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        The main idea of the {\em distance rationalizability} approach to view the
voters' preferences as an imperfect approximation to some kind of consensus is
deeply rooted in social choice literature. It allows one to define
(""rationalize"") voting rules via a consensus class of elections and a distance:
a candidate is said to be an election winner if she is ranked first in one of
the nearest (with respect to the given distance) consensus elections. It is
known that many classic voting rules can be distance rationalized. In this
paper, we provide new results on distance rationalizability of several
Condorcet-consistent voting rules. In particular, we distance rationalize
Young's rule and Maximin rule using distances similar to the Hamming distance.
We show that the claim that Young's rule can be rationalized by the Condorcet
consensus class and the Hamming distance is incorrect; in fact, these consensus
class and distance yield a new rule which has not been studied before. We prove
that, similarly to Young's rule, this new rule has a computationally hard
winner determination problem.

        We prove that every Condorcet-consistent voting rule can be manipulated by a
voter who completely reverses their preference ranking, assuming that there are
at least 4 alternatives. This corrects an error and improves a result of
[Sanver, M. R. and Zwicker, W. S. (2009). One-way monotonicity as a form of
strategy-proofness. Int J Game Theory 38(4), 553-574.] For the case of
precisely 4 alternatives, we exactly characterise the number of voters for
which this impossibility result can be proven. We also show analogues of our
result for irresolute voting rules. We then leverage our result to state a
strong form of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem.

By classifying cases based on the number of voters and other parameters, they delineate the boundaries of tractability for these problems. This work complements our investigation by underscoring the computational aspects of Condorcet extensions, particularly in the context of three-candidate elections, where paradoxes such as the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes are prevalent.

The manipulation of Condorcet-consistent voting rules is another critical theme explored in the literature. Peters (2017) addresses the preference reversal paradox, demonstrating the vulnerability of these rules to strategic manipulation by voters. This study is instrumental in understanding the broader implications of Condorcet extensions, as it reveals inherent weaknesses that can be exploited under certain conditions. Our research builds on this foundation by examining specific paradoxes that arise in three-candidate scenarios, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations and potential refinements of Condorcet extensions.

The Maximin rule, a central focus of our paper, has been extended to various voting contexts, as illustrated by Sánchez-Fernández et al. (2016). Their work on the maximin support method extends the D'Hondt apportionment method to approval-based multiwinner elections, showcasing the versatility and applicability of maximin principles. This extension is particularly relevant to our study, as it highlights the adaptability of maximin refinements in addressing paradoxes within Condorcet extensions. By demonstrating the immunity of certain maximin refinements to the reinforcement and no-show paradoxes, our research aligns with the broader discourse on enhancing the robustness of voting rules.

In summary, our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on Condorcet extensions by providing a focused analysis of their susceptibility to paradoxes in three-candidate elections. By establishing the conditions under which these paradoxes occur and identifying refinements of maximin that are immune to them, we offer a novel perspective on the suitability of these voting rules. Our axiomatic characterizations of maximin and its refinements further enrich the theoretical landscape, paving the way for future research on the refinement and application of Condorcet-consistent rules in diverse electoral contexts."

        Source Paper Abstract:
        A voting rule is a Condorcet extension if it returns a candidate that beats every
other candidate in pairwise majority comparisons whenever one exists. Condorcet
extensions have faced criticism due to their susceptibility to variable-electorate
paradoxes, especially the reinforcement paradox (Young and Levenglick, 1978) and
the no-show paradox (Moulin, 1988b). In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility
of Condorcet extensions to these paradoxes for the case of exactly three candidates.
For the reinforcement paradox, we establish that it must occur for every Condorcet
extension when there are at least eight voters and demonstrate that certain refinements
of maximin—a voting rule originally proposed by Condorcet (1785)—are immune
to this paradox when there are at most seven voters. For the no-show paradox, we
prove that the only homogeneous Condorcet extensions immune to it are refinements
of maximin. We also provide axiomatic characterizations of maximin and two of
its refinements, Nanson’s rule and leximin, highlighting their suitability for threecandidate elections.
        
        Related Work Paper Abstract:
        Consider elections where the set of candidates is partitioned into parties,
and each party must nominate exactly one candidate. The Possible President
problem asks whether some candidate of a given party can become the winner of
the election for some nominations from other parties. We perform a multivariate
computational complexity analysis of Possible President for a range of
Condorcet-consistent voting rules, namely for Copeland$^\alpha$ for $\alpha \in
[0,1]$ and Maximin. The parameters we study are the number of voters, the
number of parties, and the maximum size of a party. For all voting rules under
consideration, we obtain dichotomies based on the number of voters, classifying
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete and polynomial-time solvable cases. Moreover, for each
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete variant, we determine the parameterized complexity of
every possible parameterization with the studied parameters as either (a)
fixed-parameter tractable, (b) $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard but in $\mathsf{XP}$, or
(c) $\mathsf{paraNP}$-hard, outlining the limits of tractability for these
problems.
